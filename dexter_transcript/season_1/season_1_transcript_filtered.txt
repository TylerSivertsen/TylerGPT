Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.



Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.



Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.



But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.



I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.Previously on "Dexter"...

You still don't remember anything from before?

You know, before we took you in?

No.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

Mama!

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad.

And this is Rudy.

Dexter.

Hey.

I have waited a long time to meet you.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell's this guy thinking?

And the real king is still out there.

Hungry. Ready.

He'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think --

I'm falling for him.

Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

No!

f*cking whore!

Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday.

Can't be late Monday. Throws the whole week off.

What about breakfast?

Made and eaten.

And the kids' lunches?

Packed and ready to go.

Did you tell the locksmith?

Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven-pin keyways.

I want to talk to your mom for a sec.

Are you gonna make out?

None of your business.

Are you?

Astor.

Rita, you don't have to do this, you know.

Getting att*cked by your ex-husband merits a day off.

I'm fine.

I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore.

Those days are over.

It's gonna be okay. The police have been notified.

They'll find him.

What if they don't?

I got you some pepper spray.

Just aim for the eyes.

Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

I had some at Kirk's birthday,

10 days ago.

See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here.

Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think.

It started out vanilla.

Guys, you should look at this.

Put that thing down, for God's sake.

It was addressed to Homicide.

Put it down!

Jesus, is that blood?

Morgan, get your a*s over here.

a*s en route.

You're the blood expert. What is this sh*t?

It's a little watery for jam.

Maybe you should open it.

What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released?

I got to wash my hands.

So gullible.

What is it?

Well, it's definitely blood.

Wait, there's something in here.

Marina View hotel.

It's a key.

May be some sort of promotional gag.

You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood.

Show-and-tell's over.

Let's try and find out who sent this.

Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.

Batista's still working on the expl*si*n at the smack lab.

Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.

A jar of blood --

Dramatic, cryptic, playful.

Could it be him?

Got an extra key from the manager.

Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.

The guy who checked into 103

was white and normal looking.

I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here.

It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security.

Better be ready to cancel your lunch.

Police. Open up.

Oh, my God. Jesus. Get back in your room.

Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8

out at the Marina View hotel.

I need uniformed backup, forensics.

f*ck it. Just send everybody out.

It's been a while since we went prophylactic.

Not me. Last night, I met this chick --

I'll stop you right there, Vince.

So, they tell you anything about what's inside?

No one's been inside. Too much blood.

Dexter.

Just a heads-up -- It's bad in there.

Okay.

I'm serious.

Okay.

She's not kidding. It's your wet dream in there.

Okay.

You're going in first alone.

Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report. Don't f*ck up.

Now I'm really curious.

He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me?

Mommy!

Tell me you found something, Morgan.

I talked to the guests in room 105.

They didn't see anyone go in or out.

What about across the hall?

German tourists. They got their head up their lederhosen.

They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming.

Oh, my god!

Hey. Hey, you okay?

I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there.

Never should have skipped breakfast.

Bullshit. You're shaking. What the hell happened up there?

No, I'm okay. I just need a little air.

Something finally got to you.

I guess you're human after all.

Cut him some slack, all right?

I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar.

Tell us what you saw, Dex.

How many dead?

A lot.

But no bodies, just blood --

50, 60 liters.

Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know.

You're saying there was a mass m*rder in there, but they took the bodies?

How is that possible?

There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms.

Someone would have seen corpses coming out.

I don't f*cking know.

Hey, Dexter, you all right?

I can't go back in there.

You don't have to.

Fine.

Just get yourself cleaned up and --

I don't know -- Work from the hallway or something.

You're in room 422.

Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags.

Dade county sheriff's department.

I'm looking for Rita Bennett.

That's me. Did you find Paul?

I'm sorry?

Paul Bennett.

My ex-husband att*cked me last night.

My boyfriend filed a police report.

The only report we have is the one that Mr. Bennett filed.

What? Wait.

Paul filed a police report? For what?

as*ault. Your ex-husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital.

He's pressing charges against you.

He att*cked me!

Not according to him.

All right. Can we talk about this later?

We need a formal statement.

You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station.

Fine.

Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from. All right?

Sweet.

You should really get in here, Dex.

I never seen anything like this.

Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts.

Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue. Come see.

Photos, Vince.

Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting?

The blood's not clotting?

No.

Genuine medical mystery.

Just keep getting samples.

I'll test it at the lab.

Hello? Don't hang up.

Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station.

Paul's pressing as*ault charges against me.

How's it even possible? I was defending myself.

Just stay calm. I know a lawyer.

I'll straighten it out.

I am calm.

They're the hysterical ones.

They're charging me with a class-2 felony.

Hello, Dexter? Are you there?

Yeah, I'm right here.

This is ridiculous.

I could lose my job. I could lose my kids.

I won't let that happen.

Well, I'm glad you're so confident.

Rita, just trust me.

I know how the system works.

Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.

You okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Thank you.

Yeah, bye.

Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out.

What? A wall socket?

Yeah.

Of course there's a wall socket. There's lots of wall --

Hey, you're right.

There was something plugged in here -- probably a power tool to cut them up.

Come take a look.

Photos, Vince.

Lots and lots of photos.

Open Sesame.

Blood samples for the fridge.

And you better make room. There's a lot more coming.

sh**t at the Bel Canto tonight. You in?

I'm not in the mood.

Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central.

Look at this.

They were for Nina's birthday -- backstage passes to Neil Diamond.

You're in worse shape than I thought.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

Oh, Masuka was looking for you.

Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.

Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection.

A bit of an overshare.

You want to talk about what happened today?

Already did.

Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died.

Can talk to me, you know?

Just got to open your mouth and move it.

I'll call Rudy. I'll tell him I'll be late.

Deb, seriously.

I puked.

I'm fine.

I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do.

Why do you always do this?

Do what?

You shut me out!

Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you.

I still don't know how that makes you feel.

I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call.

Fine.

Whatever.

Did Paul force his way into the house?

No.

Did you ask him to leave?

Yes, and he refused.

But in your statement, it says you invited your ex-husband into your bedroom.

He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading --

Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

And you didn't want it to escalate. I understand that, but we can't prove intent.

Your ex-husband has the injuries here, not you.

Paul has a record of spousal abuse.

Spousal abuse can be mutual.

It was never mutual.

Okay.

But the man is a model parolee.

His drug tests are clean.

He's got glowing reports from the court-appointed supervisor.

Corrections will want to see this guy transition.

I don't care!

He's not going near my children. Do you understand?

Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children.

Now, you have deposition in two days.

Do not give this man any more amm*nit*on than he already has.

Okay.

Damn.

Just blood?

What happened to the bodies?

Hell if I know.

I don't want to know.

Blood was bad enough.

No wonder you seem so amped.

Your brother must have loved it.

f*ck no. He freaked.

Really?

I thought, you know, blood was his thing.

What happened?

I don' know. It was like usual. He shut me out.

Did he say anything?

Let's not talk about Dex right now.

Was it like a panic attack?

I don't know.

He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.

Kiss me.

What's the matter? You don't even have wood.

Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk.

Yeah, but not now. I'm horny.

Maybe I should call him.

Are you f*cking kidding me?

What? We -- We bonded last weekend.

Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family?

Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants.

Deb, that's not fair.

You take me out on a -- couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn?

I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.

You know what?

Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.

Okay. I'm gonna go watch  TV.

She loved him so g*dd*mn much.

She took every one of his CDs in the separation.

She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits.

Nina loved Neil Diamond. "Song Sung Blue." "September Morn."

Oh, my god -- "Kentucky Woman."

You got to love that sh*t.

That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.

Waitress! Is there a waitress?

I need a drink. Waitress!

Bro, you're a train wreck.

Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce.

I ain't ashamed.

Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.

Look...

Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask.

Comprendo?

Eighty-six the ring.

I have to take a squirt.

She's gonna f*ck me silly.

My sister's right. I don't share my problems with her...

Or with anybody.

Harry taught me that -- Secrecy, self-reliance, and a well-stocked cupboard of hefty bags.

Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage...

Until that boy in the blood.

He scares me. I want him to go away.

You awake?

What?

Are you sure you locked the door?

Yeah, I'm positive -- Bolt and chain.

What am I gonna do?

Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

And I will.

I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own.

Fortunately, Rita's has a name.

Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103



left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.



One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.



Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.



You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.



So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.



I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --



Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.
Previously on "Dexter"...

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

It's Paul. He...

He violated Florida's three-strikes law.

The cops picked him up totally strung out on heroin.

He's back in jail.

Holy sh*t! They're f*cking fingertips.

He started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

Menthol?

Like cough drops.

I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he...

Son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

I was confused because I love you.

What did you say?

I love you.

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

No, it's -- I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.

I need an ambulance at

1228 Calendar Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.

The same images running through my head over and over.

I was there.

I saw my mother's death.

A buried memory, forgotten all these years.

It climbed inside me that day.

And it's been with me ever since --

My dark passenger.

You should be focusing on me, socio.

Seriously want to get the m*therf*cker that did this to Batista.

I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.

How's he doing? Do we know?

Still in surgery.

Laguerta's there.

God, I hate feeling so helpless.

What, no jokes about providing gross sexual comfort in a time of crisis?

Our friend was stabbed...

And he might die.

Officer Morgan.

What do you think, Dex?

He put up a fight. There was a struggle.

Attaboy, Angel.

Here, this trail --

Steady stream of drops.

He had a few seconds. Tried to move away until -- till he fell.

So much blood.

What's happening to me?

No way.

You're the one I'm supposed to meet.

In the flesh.

You know, I was just talking to someone about you.

That tickles.

Don't stop.

I wouldn't dream of stopping.

You're so different this time --

Gentle.

Are you gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again?

Actually, your...

...imperfection is what saved you the first time.

Saved me from what?

True artistry.

The message of my work is -- not in the product itself, but rather the presentation.

That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.

It's quite unsightly, actually.

Hey, you don't have to be an as*h*le about it.

Hey, hey, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to offend.

Truthfully...

I'm thankful for you.

You're my escape plan.

Escape from what?

The police.

Because of you, I've had to speed up my... project.

I need something to distract them by.

And I always found a freshly chopped-up body always does the trick.

Wait, wait! No!

Don't struggle.

That never helps.

I'm compressing your carotid artery, and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.

In about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.

Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.

Okay, I guess you went to bed.

Or you fell asleep on the couch watching "Xena" reruns, which I still think makes you a dork.

Either way, call me when you get this, okay?

Miss you.

He's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.

So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.

No. I mean, I can't.

Alright. I understand.

You need to be there for your friend.

I haven't told the kids yet.

Told them about Angel?

No, about Paul...

Being back in prison?

I hate breaking their hearts. They think so much of their dad now.

Right.

You know what?

Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.

Thanks.

They're actually coming out right now. I got to go.

Angel sustained severe internal injuries.

He lost a lot of blood.

But... the surgery was successful.

It looks like our boy's out of the woods.

I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.

But I can't focus.

I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

I need to know what it means.

Morgan.

What the f*ck is wrong with you?

I have someplace I have to be.

Well, we all got someplace to be.

But you just found out that somebody who was supposed to be your friend is gonna live.

Does that make you feel anything?

Anything at all?

Take your f*cking hand off me.

Just what I always thought.

Right.

♪ Deck the halls with parts of bodies ♪
♪ La-da-da-da dum ♪

sh*t. Just what I need.

Hey.

I know it's late.

I guess you didn't get my message.

I drove by and saw your car.

I can go.

Get your a*s in here.

It's about time you see where I live anyway.

You have no idea how much I needed this.

You feel good.

And cold. You're freezing!

Well, then stay and keep me warm.

This Batista thing has gotten to you, hasn't it?

Angel's daughter was there.

That's got to be rough.

Daughter of a cop --

Just like you.

Yeah.

I remember what that's like --

Kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.

Let's get out of town for the weekend --

Just the two of us.

We need to talk.

I'm sitting right here.

Nope.

The time has got to be right.

Okay.

It'll have to wait...

At least till we catch the as*h*le who did this to Batista.

Let me warn you -- I can be very persistent.

I need to get out of town, and I need you... to come... with me.

What I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.

I'm totally wired from all this sh*t.

Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.

My loving arms.

And...

I got a little thing to help you sleep.

That ain't no little thing.

I meant Valium.

It's one of the perks working at the hospital.

Wine and Valium?

I'll be totally helpless.

You read my mind.

Well, as I live and breathe!

You miss me?

You and the bear claws you're hiding behind your back.

This must be important.

Haven't seen much of you lately.

No rest for the wicked.

How's Gene?

Good days and bad.

He just finished his first round of radiation.

Well, he's a good guy.

Not much of a bridge player, though.

Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and I would take them to the cleaners.

I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.

Well, sure thing.

Got a date?

Not exactly.

It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

I wish I could help, but... everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basement at City Hall.

And... as you can see, I'm up to my you-know-what in year-end reports, so...

It's my lieutenant.

Camilla, is there anything you remember?

What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his home and give you a loving family.

I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.

Who found the body parts?

I did.

They were left under the tree.

I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around...

Till I found the head.

I told him not to touch anything, but he never listens.

God, Patty, you're such a b*tch.

Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary before you found the body?

There were some broken ornaments by the tree.

Who could do something like this so close to Christmas?

The Grinch.

Oh, you're a f*cking riot, Max!

Like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this.

There go our jobs.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Oh, sucks to be an elf.

...Get some visual surveillance.

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim. Cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

Yep. And after the bloodbath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the press on this one.

James!

Yeah?

I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.

And will somebody turn off this g*dd*mn snow machine?!

Your sister can help you out.

That a whole sexual-tension thing or am I missing something?

103.

It's the same numbers he left at Marina View hotel.

Any leads as to what they mean?

We've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers

-- Nothing.

They need more to go on.

First he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.

Now he leaves me this --

A calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.

It doesn't make sense.

Crime scene's wiped clean.

Another hooker?

Ho, ho, ho -- Another dead ho.

Somebody's been naughty.

Hey, Morgan.

Want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for Christmas?

And he's back!

No, thanks.

Last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.

This doesn't seem right.

Body parts scattered among the presents.

Broken ornaments.

It's not his usual meticulous style.

It seems rushed...

Haphazard.

That would explain why we can't find one of the hands.

What's wrong?

There's something underneath the torso.

Merry Christmas, Miami.

After all this time, why do you think the ice-truck k*ller has struck again?

Any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.



Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?



None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?



After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.



Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.
Previously on "Dexter"...

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim, cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Dexter...

Laura Moser...

My mother.

Laura Moser and 3 others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

Angel was stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place.

You really don't want to do this.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

Yes, yes, yes.

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Where the f*ck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.

I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

I've lived in darkness a long time.

Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I don't have much time -- or, to be more accurate, my sister doesn't have much time.

He wants me to find him, but where do I look?

I can't think.

It's too bright.

Let me know if the tape's too tight.

You know, there's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

Why are you doing this?

Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.

Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Shh, I'm just checking the supplies, okay?

Things are moving a little faster than I had planned.

This isn't you.

Pretty sure it is.

No!

I know there's more -- I've seen it.

I never wanted to hurt you.

I know. I know.

Does this make it easier for you? Because I can keep going.

Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!

There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb. I mean, you're not the only one who bought it, okay?

Your name isn't even f*cking Rudy Cooper, is it?

Nope...

But he died for a good cause.

Yeah, so will you.

You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

Not some invisible hooker -- you kidnapped a cop!

It's all part of the plan.

Oh, Jesus.

It's hard to believe it's almost come to fruition.

I mean, this is a lot of years in the making.

We're only hours away.

He wouldn't have taken Deb unless he left me everything a clever monster would need in order to find them.

♪ Born free, ♪
♪ As free as the wind blows ♪
♪ As free as the grass grows ♪
♪ Born free to follow your heart ♪

Seems I have a new screen saver.

I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded, but "Born free"?

Of course.

Thanks to Rudy, now I know where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

Born free of all that's human --

That's where I'll find him.

She knows.

She knows.

All f*cking night with that.

She knows.

Listen, Angel, we need your help.

Masuka says you were following up a lead on the ice-truck k*ller when you were att*cked.

A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

John painted her nails different colors, but it didn't go nowhere.

Except she was just cut up by the ice-truck k*ller.

Holy sh*t. Monique was a victim?

Now, we're operating on the theory that he found out you were on his trail.

And if we're right, that means you got stabbed for a reason. It wasn't no carjacking.

How did he know it was me?

No one knew what I was doing except Masuka.

Someone else had to know. Think.

I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.

But that's crazy, right?

No, she's been AWOL since going out last night to meet him.

She was supposed to come back and help me canvass, but she never made it.

That's not like her.

Angel, we got to go.

Go, just go.

There are roughly 5,000 cargo containers in the port of Miami.

Finding the one where my mother was butchered took a bit of magic.

Busted.

Busted.

sh*t.

Just a second!

I told you he was here.

There some reason you're not answering your damn phone?

Ambien.

What happened here, Dexter?

I couldn't find the remote.

Where's your sister?

She didn't come back to work, and she's not at her apartment.

I honestly don't know, sergeant.

Dexter...

We think her boyfriend Rudy's connected to the ice-truck k*ller.

We're working on getting a search warrant right now to search his home.

No. Wow...

Cut the crap.

You know something. What?

James!

I saw him last night, skulking in the lab, ordering secret blood tests.

What kind of tests?

I was looking for a type match on the blood on Batista's collar.

And whose was it?

Rudy's.

m*therf*cker.

Knock it off!

He knew all along!

Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.

Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

It was just a wild hunch.

Why didn't you tell us?

I couldn't destroy Deb's love life on a hunch.

I had to get the facts.

Here are the facts: if he kills her, it's your fault. Now, what else do you know?

That's it.

He's lying.

Give him a break, James. It's his sister, all right?

Well, if he knows what's good for her, he'll sit his a*s at home and answer the f*cking phone when it rings.

Call if you hear anything.

Hello?

Please don't hang up.

Paul?

The kids don't want to talk to you, all right?

You got to give them more time.

This isn't about them.

It's about how I was arrested.

Yeah, with a needle in your arm -- I know all about it.

Well, I don't.

Listen, I take responsibility for all the sh*t I pulled, but, Rita, I was in the program.

I kicked the hard stuff.

Well, apparently not.

I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.

It's been driving me nuts how I got -- from your house one minute to the motel room the next, completely out of my mind on junk.

Yeah, it's called a blackout, Paul.

It's called a setup.

Well done.

The last thing I remember was standing in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

Now, he could have smacked me over the head and dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.

You really are a piece of work.

I'm telling you --

Dexter is not who you think he is.

Hello?

This one, I've got to make sure we got about seven copies of these.

I want to make sure it's distributed to everyone, okay?

Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.

Some of you may have met him.

He was dating officer Morgan.

Now, she was last seen 16 hours ago, driving to meet him at the Miami Beach marina.

So we need to canvass the entire area.

Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

I've already sent a team over to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

The judge just signed off on the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

Well, let's tear that place apart.

Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

Your attention, please.

I want to introduce you to our new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.

She agreed to put her vacation on hold, come in early, to provide us with some much-needed leadership at this critical time.

Lieutenant, you're on.

I understand we have a new suspect in the ice-truck k*ller case.

We're on our way over now to search his place.

And you are...

Maria Laguerta.

And we have an officer missing, so we need to move fast.

I thought that sergeant Doakes was running that investigation.

He's out following a lead.

What lead?

He said he'd let me know if it came to anything. Now if you excuse me --

I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

Who here can get me up to speed on the way over?

I can, I guess.

You're driving.

And feel free to join us when you locate your partner.

Would you like to come with us, captain?

You seem to have everything under control.

Let's go, people.

It's in there somewhere --

My birthplace.

Now what?

No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

With billions spent on Homeland Security, it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

So much for the w*r on terror.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

I don't like this place.

Something nameless was born here...

Something that lives in the deepest, darkest hole of the thing called "Dexter."

Get in there!

Somebody else -- Get in there now!

It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

Nothing will hurt you -- I promise.

Okay, Deb... don't be dead.

sh*t.

Surprise, m*therf*cker.

Are you following me now?

You better have a hell of a reason for being here.

I'm looking for my sister.

In a cargo box?

Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.

You forget you work for the f*cking cops?

We love theories. Spin me a story, as*h*le.

What I do on my time is my business, sergeant.

Yeah, me too, and I'm on my time now.

There's no lieutenant here to save your a*s, so don't f*ck with me, Morgan!

All right, you got me.

I ordered some furniture from Thailand.

I was waiting for it to be delivered.

Lab geek -- My a*s.

Hey, what the hell's going on over here?!

Security, I need to get somebody down here right now.

Miami metro P.D.

Yeah Is this guy under arrest?

That's a good question.

You're connected to this.

I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your a*s.

Let me out of here, m*therf*cker!

Let me out of here!

Let me out! Let me out! Let me out, you piece of sh*t!

Let me out of here, you f*cking piece -- Aah!

f*ck! Let me out!

Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio, and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

Bye!

His happy place, where he kills more than time --

This is where he'd leave me a clue.

Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.

I like the cold.

You know, hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.

Yeah, and so can hypochondria.

And a home setup like this would take years to put together.

He must have hated leaving it behind.

What are you looking for?

A clue, signature or calling card --

Anything that might give us a sense of where he went.

Well, I don't think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this.

I mean, look at this place.

Hey, you were right about the victim at Santa's cottage.

He rushed his work.

He k*lled that girl to keep us busy so he could escape, but he wouldn't go without leaving us a message.

We just need to find it.

Check this out.

This is where he played with his meat.

Pretty whacked out, huh?

I can think of 101

uses for this table.

Know what I mean?

He has my sister, Vince.

Right.

I mean -- I didn't mean -- I'm sorry.

sh*t.

You're Karen, right?

That's right.

You're in charge of evidence -- this entire room -- evidence.

Take photos of every item in its original position: work-kit, packages...

Show me the inventory list when you're done.

Is he in charge?

Guess he is now.

Rita?

Rita?

Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

Can I help you?

I guess Paul never mentioned me.

I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

Right.

So, having your sponsor do your dirty work --

Which step is that?

See, he's -- he's just concerned for the kids.

No, he's concerned for himself. If you'll excuse me...

I thought he was lying, too, until I saw the proof.

What proof?

Well, the X-rays the prison doctor took of Paul's head --

They showed a skull fracture.

Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

No. You didn't.

See, after you struck him, the hospital took X-rays -- No fracture.

But in prison, a fracture.

If you know Paul, you'd know he'd bash his own head against the wall to get what he wants.

Well, I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.



No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!



The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.



His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.Previously on "Dexter"..

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again.

Has to happen.

There he is. He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

You better be a cop.

No... Forensics.

There is no blood near the body at all.

It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

One of these days, you're gonna tell me.

I told you blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

How the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Please, you have to understand.

Trust me. I definitely understand.

Hello?

What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

They found another hooker.

Another one?

That's the third one in five months.

Third? You mean there's a...

Serial k*ller, that's right.

Dex, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Of course, you have to learn how to spot them, but I can teach you.



The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.



I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...



Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

♪ ven conmigo... ♪
♪ junto a mi corazón ♪

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.



Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".



Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.



Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.Previously on "Dexter"...

What happened changed something inside you, Dex.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

What can I do to help?

No blood. What a beautiful idea.

Refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "hey, want to play?"



Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.



We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.



Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.



Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.



As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?



Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.



However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.
Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood. What a gorgeous idea.

Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold environment... to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man. You did... when you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam. You in?

Hey, man. Sounds good.

I thought you said you wanted to go get sh*t-faced.

I am sh*t-faced.

I showed my face to Guerrero, to his whole church.

They're gonna think I'm behind this sh*t.

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

He's escalating the thrill, posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show us what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Fingertips.

f*ckin' as*h*le, that's my girl.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

I find people around me are always making some kind of connection, like friendship or romance, but human bonds always lead to messy complications... commitment, sharing, driving people to the airport.

Besides, if I let someone get that close,

So, time to put on my mask.

I need your expertise.

I live to serve.

Excuse us, fellas.

Interesting hand job.

That's funny.

It is?

So, how long you think it's been there?

This feels familiar.

Okay. So, how long has it been there?

Blood stopped pooling, still wet... couple hours at the most.

What time was it found?

A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.

No prints. Wiped clean. Real creep show, huh?

Any sign of the rest of the body?

Just Mr. Hand. Do you think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

It's hard to say. There's blood. That's different.

Plus, it's a male victim-- haven't seen that before.

The cut appears to be almost delicate.

You see between the first and second row of carpals...

Very surgical.

Check out what else he left behind.

A little postcard to remember him by.

How far is Rand Beach from here?

This is Rand Beach.

It was renamed Petrie Beach a few years ago.

Okay, everybody.

Everybody say "stinky feet".

Stinky feet!

Wait. Nobody move. Dexter, were you smiling?

No.

Okay, we'll do another one.

This time, everybody smiles. You, too, Dex.

Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.

Shut your damn face, Deb.

Hey, language, please.

What? She always talks like that.

Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.

What's your problem?

I hate the beach.

It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.

Too bad. You're part of a family.

And being part of a family means smiling for photos.

Why should I pretend I'm happy?

Because it'll make your mom happy, and because it's how you fit in.

Remember we talked about that?

Yeah.

This is how you do it.

When somebody takes your picture, you smile.

It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

You just do it to fit in. Okay?

Okay.

All right.

Come here, handsome.

Okay. Everybody ready? One more time.

Stinky feet!

Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.

Straight to the station after, yeah. Thanks, lieutenant.



Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...



Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.



Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...



Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.



Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...



And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.Previously on "Dexter"...

Think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

It's the guard-- Tucci.

I think he's alive.

Tucci's alive?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

He's sending me a message.

He wants me to go there.

Please.

He was left here so I would k*ll him.

Just k*ll me.

I can't k*ll this man.

Taking Tucci over to County alive.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

The thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be. I'm Dexter.

I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone, maybe post-apocalypse or plague, Whatever-- No one left to act normal for, no need to hide who I really am.

It would be

...freeing.

Stop grinning like a f*cking psycho and get back to work.

Sorry, sergeant.

I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before I tear the bed apart.

I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

My shadow companion chose this place well.

This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.

All these people pawing over it seems...

He was here for days, playing with sharp objects.

I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless, amazingly so.

The only blood I found belongs to the security guard.

Has he said anything yet?

Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

Lieutenant, up here!

There's got to be something here. Find it.

The guy's not a ghost. Tony Tucci is evidence of that.

Hey, Dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet?

It's like sh**ting a Jackson Pollock.

Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.

Ready?

Okay.

What was that?

Did you see that?

What?

Damn rats.

We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their sh*t in the dust.

We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.

Lovely. Can we get the lights, guys?

You ever heard of rat-bite fever?

Masuka, what'd I say about the f*cking rats?

You haven't found anything, won't find anything.

This is a bust, right?

In so many words.

Which means I'm just jerking off till Tucci wakes up.

So take a break. You've been working this thing 24-7.

Or are you still avoiding a personal life?

Oh, f*ck you.

And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.

Thanks, guys.

It doesn't have to be either/or.

Maybe not for you.

If I found someone, so can you, right?

Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

Tell me about it.

Yelina? Are you okay?

I'm sorry. I'm fine.

Ernesto hasn't arrived?

I'm sure he'll be here soon.

No.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Coyote?

You mean the man you paid to bring him here?

He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.

But that was a week ago, and no one in Cárdenas has heard from Ernesto.

Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

...This was his number, but it's not working anymore.

I was supposed to leave him money in a park.

Listen, my boyfriend works for the police. I'm sure he--

No, no, no. We can't go to the police.

He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba.

No, it's okay. It's okay. Dexter will know what to do.

I feel just terrible for her.

And they were supposed to be married after he got here.

I do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues.

I can talk to him.

That's really kind of you, Dex.

I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your fiancée is dead or alive?

Uh, no.

Every night after work Yelina goes across the street, to the beach.

I've seen her there, just... staring out at the water, willing him to walk out of it.

Have you ever longed for anything like that?

She wants something from me. Ever since the blow job, she assumes we've taken it to the next level.

She doesn't know yet-- I don't have a next level.

Well, when I was a kid, I would have k*lled for an Atari.

You know?

Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man...

It always comes to this once sex is introduced.

Small talk no longer cuts it.

Eventually she'll call me a science project and slam the door in my face.

But when do you think he'll wake up?

Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a k*ller out there that's into whores and security guards, but I'll bet nurses are next.

Yo, check you, all "MPD Blue".

Shanda, what are you doing here?

You have another lead on the ice-truck k*ller?

Man, I got bigger worries than that sick sh*t.

Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?

I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what you're after.

Oh, hell, no.

But my landlord's another f*cking story--

Trying to kick me out of my home.

Shanda.

He got no cause, except he's a born-again hypocrite m*therf*cker.

Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?

No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.

Morgan. Found this in evidence.

Masuka was gonna grease it through.

A cigarette butt?

Jesus, we could pull DNA off of that, or even a print.

Except it would be your print.

You were smoking on a crime scene.

Not on the crime scene-- like on the way-far end of the park.

The whole area's a crime scene. You should know that by now.



Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.



Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.



Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.



Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.



I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.
Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...



...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?



¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.



And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.



If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.



Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.



So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...



...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?



¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.



And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.



If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.



Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.



So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.

Hey, Angel, I got him!

They really found the ice-truck k*ller?

I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.

Son of a b*tch.

I have so many questions for him.

What was his message to me?

Now I need to know him.

Hi.

The f*ck are you?

Paul Bennett. Father on parole.

Dexter Morgan.

I can't think of anything clever to say.

Divorce papers -- Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I'd better make the most of them.

Your instincts were dead-on.

They're always dead-on when it comes to K*llers. Why is that?

I'm watchin' you.

What are we looking at here?

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

You?

No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?

Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you?

I like seafood.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

Not as hard as her.

Damn power outages.

I don't know, Angel.

Most firearm suicides are committed by men.

Women tend to slash their wrists, take pills, something more ladylike.

Not in Miami.

We closed a couple of su1c1de cases just like this last year, remember?

Look at this mess.

That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?

House husband. And aspiring artist.

Promising.

So, she supported him?

It looks like that.

She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

Those other suicides we closed -- those were high-powered women too, right?

I don't know. I think so.

Note to self.

I don't care what it looks like. Somebody k*lled her.

We're checking out all the possibilities, Mr. Gayle.

Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem?

You know, job stress, the usual, but she was working through it in therapy.

She have any other problems that you're aware of? Threats?



Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.



I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.



It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.



You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.



Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?



To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.



You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪
♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪
♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪
♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.Previously on "Dexter"...

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No, he's got unfinished business with me. "Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."

Paul called after you left.

He's already out of jail -- Overcrowding.

Can you believe it?

Are you f*cking my wife?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

I just wish he'd go away.

Why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you to.

It's different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love. "Barbie, be patient. "One day we'll share a cold one."

Thank god for showers. Private time to think --

Harder to come by now that I'm in a real relationship.

Do you mind?

Not at all.

Could you pass the soap?

Yeah.

It's locked!

Mom, I got to pee!

I'll be right there, sweetie!

Hold on a second, buddy!

I can't!

Sorry. One-bathroom house.

Nature calls.

Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?

Cody!

Sword fight -- I won.

Mom, I got to brush.

Whatever happened to knocking?

I'm gonna be late for school.

You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna...

I mean, what does "separation" mean to you?

What "separation" means to me is that you're separated, and you work it out. Now, this was false pretenses.

I mean, I knew she wanted a divorce when she asked for the separation -- she lied.



Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.



I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...



And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.



Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.



If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.



Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.



Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.



Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.



Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.



But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.



I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.
Previously on "Dexter"...

You still don't remember anything from before?

You know, before we took you in?

No.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

Mama!

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad.

And this is Rudy.

Dexter.

Hey.

I have waited a long time to meet you.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell's this guy thinking?

And the real king is still out there.

Hungry. Ready.

He'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think --

I'm falling for him.

Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

No!

f*cking whore!

Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday.

Can't be late Monday. Throws the whole week off.

What about breakfast?

Made and eaten.

And the kids' lunches?

Packed and ready to go.

Did you tell the locksmith?

Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven-pin keyways.

I want to talk to your mom for a sec.

Are you gonna make out?

None of your business.

Are you?

Astor.

Rita, you don't have to do this, you know.

Getting att*cked by your ex-husband merits a day off.

I'm fine.

I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore.

Those days are over.

It's gonna be okay. The police have been notified.

They'll find him.

What if they don't?

I got you some pepper spray.

Just aim for the eyes.

Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

I had some at Kirk's birthday,

10 days ago.

See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here.

Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think.

It started out vanilla.

Guys, you should look at this.

Put that thing down, for God's sake.

It was addressed to Homicide.

Put it down!

Jesus, is that blood?

Morgan, get your a*s over here.

a*s en route.

You're the blood expert. What is this sh*t?

It's a little watery for jam.

Maybe you should open it.

What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released?

I got to wash my hands.

So gullible.

What is it?

Well, it's definitely blood.

Wait, there's something in here.

Marina View hotel.

It's a key.

May be some sort of promotional gag.

You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood.

Show-and-tell's over.

Let's try and find out who sent this.

Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.

Batista's still working on the expl*si*n at the smack lab.

Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.

A jar of blood --

Dramatic, cryptic, playful.

Could it be him?

Got an extra key from the manager.

Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.

The guy who checked into 103

was white and normal looking.

I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here.

It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security.

Better be ready to cancel your lunch.

Police. Open up.

Oh, my God. Jesus. Get back in your room.

Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8

out at the Marina View hotel.

I need uniformed backup, forensics.

f*ck it. Just send everybody out.

It's been a while since we went prophylactic.

Not me. Last night, I met this chick --

I'll stop you right there, Vince.

So, they tell you anything about what's inside?

No one's been inside. Too much blood.

Dexter.

Just a heads-up -- It's bad in there.

Okay.

I'm serious.

Okay.

She's not kidding. It's your wet dream in there.

Okay.

You're going in first alone.

Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report. Don't f*ck up.

Now I'm really curious.

He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me?

Mommy!

Tell me you found something, Morgan.

I talked to the guests in room 105.

They didn't see anyone go in or out.

What about across the hall?

German tourists. They got their head up their lederhosen.

They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming.

Oh, my god!

Hey. Hey, you okay?

I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there.

Never should have skipped breakfast.

Bullshit. You're shaking. What the hell happened up there?

No, I'm okay. I just need a little air.

Something finally got to you.

I guess you're human after all.

Cut him some slack, all right?

I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar.

Tell us what you saw, Dex.

How many dead?

A lot.

But no bodies, just blood --

50, 60 liters.

Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know.

You're saying there was a mass m*rder in there, but they took the bodies?

How is that possible?

There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms.

Someone would have seen corpses coming out.

I don't f*cking know.

Hey, Dexter, you all right?

I can't go back in there.

You don't have to.

Fine.

Just get yourself cleaned up and --

I don't know -- Work from the hallway or something.

You're in room 422.

Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags.

Dade county sheriff's department.

I'm looking for Rita Bennett.

That's me. Did you find Paul?

I'm sorry?

Paul Bennett.

My ex-husband att*cked me last night.

My boyfriend filed a police report.

The only report we have is the one that Mr. Bennett filed.

What? Wait.

Paul filed a police report? For what?

as*ault. Your ex-husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital.

He's pressing charges against you.

He att*cked me!

Not according to him.

All right. Can we talk about this later?

We need a formal statement.

You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station.

Fine.

Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from. All right?

Sweet.

You should really get in here, Dex.

I never seen anything like this.

Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts.

Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue. Come see.

Photos, Vince.

Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting?

The blood's not clotting?

No.

Genuine medical mystery.

Just keep getting samples.

I'll test it at the lab.

Hello? Don't hang up.

Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station.

Paul's pressing as*ault charges against me.

How's it even possible? I was defending myself.

Just stay calm. I know a lawyer.

I'll straighten it out.

I am calm.

They're the hysterical ones.

They're charging me with a class-2 felony.

Hello, Dexter? Are you there?

Yeah, I'm right here.

This is ridiculous.

I could lose my job. I could lose my kids.

I won't let that happen.

Well, I'm glad you're so confident.

Rita, just trust me.

I know how the system works.

Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.

You okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Thank you.

Yeah, bye.

Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out.

What? A wall socket?

Yeah.

Of course there's a wall socket. There's lots of wall --

Hey, you're right.

There was something plugged in here -- probably a power tool to cut them up.

Come take a look.

Photos, Vince.

Lots and lots of photos.

Open Sesame.

Blood samples for the fridge.

And you better make room. There's a lot more coming.

sh**t at the Bel Canto tonight. You in?

I'm not in the mood.

Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central.

Look at this.

They were for Nina's birthday -- backstage passes to Neil Diamond.

You're in worse shape than I thought.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

Oh, Masuka was looking for you.

Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.

Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection.

A bit of an overshare.

You want to talk about what happened today?

Already did.

Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died.

Can talk to me, you know?

Just got to open your mouth and move it.

I'll call Rudy. I'll tell him I'll be late.

Deb, seriously.

I puked.

I'm fine.

I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do.

Why do you always do this?

Do what?

You shut me out!

Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you.

I still don't know how that makes you feel.

I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call.

Fine.

Whatever.

Did Paul force his way into the house?

No.

Did you ask him to leave?

Yes, and he refused.

But in your statement, it says you invited your ex-husband into your bedroom.

He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading --

Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

And you didn't want it to escalate. I understand that, but we can't prove intent.

Your ex-husband has the injuries here, not you.

Paul has a record of spousal abuse.

Spousal abuse can be mutual.

It was never mutual.

Okay.

But the man is a model parolee.

His drug tests are clean.

He's got glowing reports from the court-appointed supervisor.

Corrections will want to see this guy transition.

I don't care!

He's not going near my children. Do you understand?

Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children.

Now, you have deposition in two days.

Do not give this man any more amm*nit*on than he already has.

Okay.

Damn.

Just blood?

What happened to the bodies?

Hell if I know.

I don't want to know.

Blood was bad enough.

No wonder you seem so amped.

Your brother must have loved it.

f*ck no. He freaked.

Really?

I thought, you know, blood was his thing.

What happened?

I don' know. It was like usual. He shut me out.

Did he say anything?

Let's not talk about Dex right now.

Was it like a panic attack?

I don't know.

He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.

Kiss me.

What's the matter? You don't even have wood.

Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk.

Yeah, but not now. I'm horny.

Maybe I should call him.

Are you f*cking kidding me?

What? We -- We bonded last weekend.

Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family?

Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants.

Deb, that's not fair.

You take me out on a -- couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn?

I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.

You know what?

Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.

Okay. I'm gonna go watch  TV.

She loved him so g*dd*mn much.

She took every one of his CDs in the separation.

She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits.

Nina loved Neil Diamond. "Song Sung Blue." "September Morn."

Oh, my god -- "Kentucky Woman."

You got to love that sh*t.

That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.

Waitress! Is there a waitress?

I need a drink. Waitress!

Bro, you're a train wreck.

Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce.

I ain't ashamed.

Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.

Look...

Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask.

Comprendo?

Eighty-six the ring.

I have to take a squirt.

She's gonna f*ck me silly.

My sister's right. I don't share my problems with her...

Or with anybody.

Harry taught me that -- Secrecy, self-reliance, and a well-stocked cupboard of hefty bags.

Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage...

Until that boy in the blood.

He scares me. I want him to go away.

You awake?

What?

Are you sure you locked the door?

Yeah, I'm positive -- Bolt and chain.

What am I gonna do?

Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

And I will.

I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own.

Fortunately, Rita's has a name.

Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103



left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.



One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.



Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.



You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.



So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.



I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --



Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.
Previously on "Dexter"...

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

It's Paul. He...

He violated Florida's three-strikes law.

The cops picked him up totally strung out on heroin.

He's back in jail.

Holy sh*t! They're f*cking fingertips.

He started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

Menthol?

Like cough drops.

I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he...

Son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

I was confused because I love you.

What did you say?

I love you.

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

No, it's -- I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.

I need an ambulance at

1228 Calendar Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.

The same images running through my head over and over.

I was there.

I saw my mother's death.

A buried memory, forgotten all these years.

It climbed inside me that day.

And it's been with me ever since --

My dark passenger.

You should be focusing on me, socio.

Seriously want to get the m*therf*cker that did this to Batista.

I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.

How's he doing? Do we know?

Still in surgery.

Laguerta's there.

God, I hate feeling so helpless.

What, no jokes about providing gross sexual comfort in a time of crisis?

Our friend was stabbed...

And he might die.

Officer Morgan.

What do you think, Dex?

He put up a fight. There was a struggle.

Attaboy, Angel.

Here, this trail --

Steady stream of drops.

He had a few seconds. Tried to move away until -- till he fell.

So much blood.

What's happening to me?

No way.

You're the one I'm supposed to meet.

In the flesh.

You know, I was just talking to someone about you.

That tickles.

Don't stop.

I wouldn't dream of stopping.

You're so different this time --

Gentle.

Are you gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again?

Actually, your...

...imperfection is what saved you the first time.

Saved me from what?

True artistry.

The message of my work is -- not in the product itself, but rather the presentation.

That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.

It's quite unsightly, actually.

Hey, you don't have to be an as*h*le about it.

Hey, hey, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to offend.

Truthfully...

I'm thankful for you.

You're my escape plan.

Escape from what?

The police.

Because of you, I've had to speed up my... project.

I need something to distract them by.

And I always found a freshly chopped-up body always does the trick.

Wait, wait! No!

Don't struggle.

That never helps.

I'm compressing your carotid artery, and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.

In about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.

Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.

Okay, I guess you went to bed.

Or you fell asleep on the couch watching "Xena" reruns, which I still think makes you a dork.

Either way, call me when you get this, okay?

Miss you.

He's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.

So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.

No. I mean, I can't.

Alright. I understand.

You need to be there for your friend.

I haven't told the kids yet.

Told them about Angel?

No, about Paul...

Being back in prison?

I hate breaking their hearts. They think so much of their dad now.

Right.

You know what?

Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.

Thanks.

They're actually coming out right now. I got to go.

Angel sustained severe internal injuries.

He lost a lot of blood.

But... the surgery was successful.

It looks like our boy's out of the woods.

I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.

But I can't focus.

I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

I need to know what it means.

Morgan.

What the f*ck is wrong with you?

I have someplace I have to be.

Well, we all got someplace to be.

But you just found out that somebody who was supposed to be your friend is gonna live.

Does that make you feel anything?

Anything at all?

Take your f*cking hand off me.

Just what I always thought.

Right.

♪ Deck the halls with parts of bodies ♪
♪ La-da-da-da dum ♪

sh*t. Just what I need.

Hey.

I know it's late.

I guess you didn't get my message.

I drove by and saw your car.

I can go.

Get your a*s in here.

It's about time you see where I live anyway.

You have no idea how much I needed this.

You feel good.

And cold. You're freezing!

Well, then stay and keep me warm.

This Batista thing has gotten to you, hasn't it?

Angel's daughter was there.

That's got to be rough.

Daughter of a cop --

Just like you.

Yeah.

I remember what that's like --

Kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.

Let's get out of town for the weekend --

Just the two of us.

We need to talk.

I'm sitting right here.

Nope.

The time has got to be right.

Okay.

It'll have to wait...

At least till we catch the as*h*le who did this to Batista.

Let me warn you -- I can be very persistent.

I need to get out of town, and I need you... to come... with me.

What I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.

I'm totally wired from all this sh*t.

Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.

My loving arms.

And...

I got a little thing to help you sleep.

That ain't no little thing.

I meant Valium.

It's one of the perks working at the hospital.

Wine and Valium?

I'll be totally helpless.

You read my mind.

Well, as I live and breathe!

You miss me?

You and the bear claws you're hiding behind your back.

This must be important.

Haven't seen much of you lately.

No rest for the wicked.

How's Gene?

Good days and bad.

He just finished his first round of radiation.

Well, he's a good guy.

Not much of a bridge player, though.

Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and I would take them to the cleaners.

I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.

Well, sure thing.

Got a date?

Not exactly.

It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

I wish I could help, but... everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basement at City Hall.

And... as you can see, I'm up to my you-know-what in year-end reports, so...

It's my lieutenant.

Camilla, is there anything you remember?

What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his home and give you a loving family.

I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.

Who found the body parts?

I did.

They were left under the tree.

I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around...

Till I found the head.

I told him not to touch anything, but he never listens.

God, Patty, you're such a b*tch.

Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary before you found the body?

There were some broken ornaments by the tree.

Who could do something like this so close to Christmas?

The Grinch.

Oh, you're a f*cking riot, Max!

Like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this.

There go our jobs.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Oh, sucks to be an elf.

...Get some visual surveillance.

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim. Cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

Yep. And after the bloodbath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the press on this one.

James!

Yeah?

I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.

And will somebody turn off this g*dd*mn snow machine?!

Your sister can help you out.

That a whole sexual-tension thing or am I missing something?

103.

It's the same numbers he left at Marina View hotel.

Any leads as to what they mean?

We've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers

-- Nothing.

They need more to go on.

First he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.

Now he leaves me this --

A calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.

It doesn't make sense.

Crime scene's wiped clean.

Another hooker?

Ho, ho, ho -- Another dead ho.

Somebody's been naughty.

Hey, Morgan.

Want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for Christmas?

And he's back!

No, thanks.

Last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.

This doesn't seem right.

Body parts scattered among the presents.

Broken ornaments.

It's not his usual meticulous style.

It seems rushed...

Haphazard.

That would explain why we can't find one of the hands.

What's wrong?

There's something underneath the torso.

Merry Christmas, Miami.

After all this time, why do you think the ice-truck k*ller has struck again?

Any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.



Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?



None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?



After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.



Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.
Previously on "Dexter"...

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim, cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Dexter...

Laura Moser...

My mother.

Laura Moser and 3 others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

Angel was stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place.

You really don't want to do this.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

Yes, yes, yes.

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Where the f*ck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.

I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

I've lived in darkness a long time.

Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I don't have much time -- or, to be more accurate, my sister doesn't have much time.

He wants me to find him, but where do I look?

I can't think.

It's too bright.

Let me know if the tape's too tight.

You know, there's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

Why are you doing this?

Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.

Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Shh, I'm just checking the supplies, okay?

Things are moving a little faster than I had planned.

This isn't you.

Pretty sure it is.

No!

I know there's more -- I've seen it.

I never wanted to hurt you.

I know. I know.

Does this make it easier for you? Because I can keep going.

Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!

There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb. I mean, you're not the only one who bought it, okay?

Your name isn't even f*cking Rudy Cooper, is it?

Nope...

But he died for a good cause.

Yeah, so will you.

You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

Not some invisible hooker -- you kidnapped a cop!

It's all part of the plan.

Oh, Jesus.

It's hard to believe it's almost come to fruition.

I mean, this is a lot of years in the making.

We're only hours away.

He wouldn't have taken Deb unless he left me everything a clever monster would need in order to find them.

♪ Born free, ♪
♪ As free as the wind blows ♪
♪ As free as the grass grows ♪
♪ Born free to follow your heart ♪

Seems I have a new screen saver.

I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded, but "Born free"?

Of course.

Thanks to Rudy, now I know where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

Born free of all that's human --

That's where I'll find him.

She knows.

She knows.

All f*cking night with that.

She knows.

Listen, Angel, we need your help.

Masuka says you were following up a lead on the ice-truck k*ller when you were att*cked.

A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

John painted her nails different colors, but it didn't go nowhere.

Except she was just cut up by the ice-truck k*ller.

Holy sh*t. Monique was a victim?

Now, we're operating on the theory that he found out you were on his trail.

And if we're right, that means you got stabbed for a reason. It wasn't no carjacking.

How did he know it was me?

No one knew what I was doing except Masuka.

Someone else had to know. Think.

I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.

But that's crazy, right?

No, she's been AWOL since going out last night to meet him.

She was supposed to come back and help me canvass, but she never made it.

That's not like her.

Angel, we got to go.

Go, just go.

There are roughly 5,000 cargo containers in the port of Miami.

Finding the one where my mother was butchered took a bit of magic.

Busted.

Busted.

sh*t.

Just a second!

I told you he was here.

There some reason you're not answering your damn phone?

Ambien.

What happened here, Dexter?

I couldn't find the remote.

Where's your sister?

She didn't come back to work, and she's not at her apartment.

I honestly don't know, sergeant.

Dexter...

We think her boyfriend Rudy's connected to the ice-truck k*ller.

We're working on getting a search warrant right now to search his home.

No. Wow...

Cut the crap.

You know something. What?

James!

I saw him last night, skulking in the lab, ordering secret blood tests.

What kind of tests?

I was looking for a type match on the blood on Batista's collar.

And whose was it?

Rudy's.

m*therf*cker.

Knock it off!

He knew all along!

Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.

Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

It was just a wild hunch.

Why didn't you tell us?

I couldn't destroy Deb's love life on a hunch.

I had to get the facts.

Here are the facts: if he kills her, it's your fault. Now, what else do you know?

That's it.

He's lying.

Give him a break, James. It's his sister, all right?

Well, if he knows what's good for her, he'll sit his a*s at home and answer the f*cking phone when it rings.

Call if you hear anything.

Hello?

Please don't hang up.

Paul?

The kids don't want to talk to you, all right?

You got to give them more time.

This isn't about them.

It's about how I was arrested.

Yeah, with a needle in your arm -- I know all about it.

Well, I don't.

Listen, I take responsibility for all the sh*t I pulled, but, Rita, I was in the program.

I kicked the hard stuff.

Well, apparently not.

I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.

It's been driving me nuts how I got -- from your house one minute to the motel room the next, completely out of my mind on junk.

Yeah, it's called a blackout, Paul.

It's called a setup.

Well done.

The last thing I remember was standing in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

Now, he could have smacked me over the head and dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.

You really are a piece of work.

I'm telling you --

Dexter is not who you think he is.

Hello?

This one, I've got to make sure we got about seven copies of these.

I want to make sure it's distributed to everyone, okay?

Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.

Some of you may have met him.

He was dating officer Morgan.

Now, she was last seen 16 hours ago, driving to meet him at the Miami Beach marina.

So we need to canvass the entire area.

Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

I've already sent a team over to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

The judge just signed off on the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

Well, let's tear that place apart.

Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

Your attention, please.

I want to introduce you to our new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.

She agreed to put her vacation on hold, come in early, to provide us with some much-needed leadership at this critical time.

Lieutenant, you're on.

I understand we have a new suspect in the ice-truck k*ller case.

We're on our way over now to search his place.

And you are...

Maria Laguerta.

And we have an officer missing, so we need to move fast.

I thought that sergeant Doakes was running that investigation.

He's out following a lead.

What lead?

He said he'd let me know if it came to anything. Now if you excuse me --

I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

Who here can get me up to speed on the way over?

I can, I guess.

You're driving.

And feel free to join us when you locate your partner.

Would you like to come with us, captain?

You seem to have everything under control.

Let's go, people.

It's in there somewhere --

My birthplace.

Now what?

No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

With billions spent on Homeland Security, it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

So much for the w*r on terror.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

I don't like this place.

Something nameless was born here...

Something that lives in the deepest, darkest hole of the thing called "Dexter."

Get in there!

Somebody else -- Get in there now!

It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

Nothing will hurt you -- I promise.

Okay, Deb... don't be dead.

sh*t.

Surprise, m*therf*cker.

Are you following me now?

You better have a hell of a reason for being here.

I'm looking for my sister.

In a cargo box?

Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.

You forget you work for the f*cking cops?

We love theories. Spin me a story, as*h*le.

What I do on my time is my business, sergeant.

Yeah, me too, and I'm on my time now.

There's no lieutenant here to save your a*s, so don't f*ck with me, Morgan!

All right, you got me.

I ordered some furniture from Thailand.

I was waiting for it to be delivered.

Lab geek -- My a*s.

Hey, what the hell's going on over here?!

Security, I need to get somebody down here right now.

Miami metro P.D.

Yeah Is this guy under arrest?

That's a good question.

You're connected to this.

I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your a*s.

Let me out of here, m*therf*cker!

Let me out of here!

Let me out! Let me out! Let me out, you piece of sh*t!

Let me out of here, you f*cking piece -- Aah!

f*ck! Let me out!

Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio, and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

Bye!

His happy place, where he kills more than time --

This is where he'd leave me a clue.

Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.

I like the cold.

You know, hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.

Yeah, and so can hypochondria.

And a home setup like this would take years to put together.

He must have hated leaving it behind.

What are you looking for?

A clue, signature or calling card --

Anything that might give us a sense of where he went.

Well, I don't think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this.

I mean, look at this place.

Hey, you were right about the victim at Santa's cottage.

He rushed his work.

He k*lled that girl to keep us busy so he could escape, but he wouldn't go without leaving us a message.

We just need to find it.

Check this out.

This is where he played with his meat.

Pretty whacked out, huh?

I can think of 101

uses for this table.

Know what I mean?

He has my sister, Vince.

Right.

I mean -- I didn't mean -- I'm sorry.

sh*t.

You're Karen, right?

That's right.

You're in charge of evidence -- this entire room -- evidence.

Take photos of every item in its original position: work-kit, packages...

Show me the inventory list when you're done.

Is he in charge?

Guess he is now.

Rita?

Rita?

Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

Can I help you?

I guess Paul never mentioned me.

I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

Right.

So, having your sponsor do your dirty work --

Which step is that?

See, he's -- he's just concerned for the kids.

No, he's concerned for himself. If you'll excuse me...

I thought he was lying, too, until I saw the proof.

What proof?

Well, the X-rays the prison doctor took of Paul's head --

They showed a skull fracture.

Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

No. You didn't.

See, after you struck him, the hospital took X-rays -- No fracture.

But in prison, a fracture.

If you know Paul, you'd know he'd bash his own head against the wall to get what he wants.

Well, I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.



No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!



The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

♪ Ring around the rosie ♪
♪ A pocket full of posies ♪

♪ We all fall down! ♪

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.



His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.
Previously on "Dexter"..

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again.

Has to happen.

There he is. He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

You better be a cop.

No... Forensics.

There is no blood near the body at all.

It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

One of these days, you're gonna tell me.

I told you blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

How the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Please, you have to understand.

Trust me. I definitely understand.

Hello?

What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

They found another hooker.

Another one?

That's the third one in five months.

Third? You mean there's a...

Serial k*ller, that's right.

Dex, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Of course, you have to learn how to spot them, but I can teach you.



The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.



I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...



Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.



Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".



Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.



Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.
Previously on "Dexter"...

What happened changed something inside you, Dex.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

What can I do to help?

No blood. What a beautiful idea.

Refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "hey, want to play?"



Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.



We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.



Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.



Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.



As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?



Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.



However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.
Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood. What a gorgeous idea.

Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold environment... to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man. You did... when you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam. You in?

Hey, man. Sounds good.

I thought you said you wanted to go get sh*t-faced.

I am sh*t-faced.

I showed my face to Guerrero, to his whole church.

They're gonna think I'm behind this sh*t.

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

He's escalating the thrill, posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show us what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Fingertips.

f*ckin' as*h*le, that's my girl.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

I find people around me are always making some kind of connection, like friendship or romance, but human bonds always lead to messy complications... commitment, sharing, driving people to the airport.

Besides, if I let someone get that close,

So, time to put on my mask.

I need your expertise.

I live to serve.

Excuse us, fellas.

Interesting hand job.

That's funny.

It is?

So, how long you think it's been there?

This feels familiar.

Okay. So, how long has it been there?

Blood stopped pooling, still wet... couple hours at the most.

What time was it found?

A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.

No prints. Wiped clean. Real creep show, huh?

Any sign of the rest of the body?

Just Mr. Hand. Do you think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

It's hard to say. There's blood. That's different.

Plus, it's a male victim-- haven't seen that before.

The cut appears to be almost delicate.

You see between the first and second row of carpals...

Very surgical.

Check out what else he left behind.

A little postcard to remember him by.

How far is Rand Beach from here?

This is Rand Beach.

It was renamed Petrie Beach a few years ago.

Okay, everybody.

Everybody say "stinky feet".

Stinky feet!

Wait. Nobody move. Dexter, were you smiling?

No.

Okay, we'll do another one.

This time, everybody smiles. You, too, Dex.

Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.

Shut your damn face, Deb.

Hey, language, please.

What? She always talks like that.

Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.

What's your problem?

I hate the beach.

It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.

Too bad. You're part of a family.

And being part of a family means smiling for photos.

Why should I pretend I'm happy?

Because it'll make your mom happy, and because it's how you fit in.

Remember we talked about that?

Yeah.

This is how you do it.

When somebody takes your picture, you smile.

It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

You just do it to fit in. Okay?

Okay.

All right.

Come here, handsome.

Okay. Everybody ready? One more time.

Stinky feet!

Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.

Straight to the station after, yeah. Thanks, lieutenant.



Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...



Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.



Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...



Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.



Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...



And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.
Previously on "Dexter"...

Think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

It's the guard-- Tucci.

I think he's alive.

Tucci's alive?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

He's sending me a message.

He wants me to go there.

Please.

He was left here so I would k*ll him.

Just k*ll me.

I can't k*ll this man.

Taking Tucci over to County alive.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

The thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be. I'm Dexter.

I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone, maybe post-apocalypse or plague, Whatever-- No one left to act normal for, no need to hide who I really am.

It would be

...freeing.

Stop grinning like a f*cking psycho and get back to work.

Sorry, sergeant.

I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before I tear the bed apart.

I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

My shadow companion chose this place well.

This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.

All these people pawing over it seems...

He was here for days, playing with sharp objects.

I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless, amazingly so.

The only blood I found belongs to the security guard.

Has he said anything yet?

Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

Lieutenant, up here!

There's got to be something here. Find it.

The guy's not a ghost. Tony Tucci is evidence of that.

Hey, Dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet?

It's like sh**ting a Jackson Pollock.

Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.

Ready?

Okay.

What was that?

Did you see that?

What?

Damn rats.

We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their sh*t in the dust.

We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.

Lovely. Can we get the lights, guys?

You ever heard of rat-bite fever?

Masuka, what'd I say about the f*cking rats?

You haven't found anything, won't find anything.

This is a bust, right?

In so many words.

Which means I'm just jerking off till Tucci wakes up.

So take a break. You've been working this thing 24-7.

Or are you still avoiding a personal life?

Oh, f*ck you.

And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.

Thanks, guys.

It doesn't have to be either/or.

Maybe not for you.

If I found someone, so can you, right?

Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

Tell me about it.

Yelina? Are you okay?

I'm sorry. I'm fine.

Ernesto hasn't arrived?

I'm sure he'll be here soon.

No.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Coyote?

You mean the man you paid to bring him here?

He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.

But that was a week ago, and no one in Cárdenas has heard from Ernesto.

Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

...This was his number, but it's not working anymore.

I was supposed to leave him money in a park.

Listen, my boyfriend works for the police. I'm sure he--

No, no, no. We can't go to the police.

He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba.

No, it's okay. It's okay. Dexter will know what to do.

I feel just terrible for her.

And they were supposed to be married after he got here.

I do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues.

I can talk to him.

That's really kind of you, Dex.

I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your fiancée is dead or alive?

Uh, no.

Every night after work Yelina goes across the street, to the beach.

I've seen her there, just... staring out at the water, willing him to walk out of it.

Have you ever longed for anything like that?

She wants something from me. Ever since the blow job, she assumes we've taken it to the next level.

She doesn't know yet-- I don't have a next level.

Well, when I was a kid, I would have k*lled for an Atari.

You know?

Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man...

It always comes to this once sex is introduced.

Small talk no longer cuts it.

Eventually she'll call me a science project and slam the door in my face.

But when do you think he'll wake up?

Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a k*ller out there that's into whores and security guards, but I'll bet nurses are next.

Yo, check you, all "MPD Blue".

Shanda, what are you doing here?

You have another lead on the ice-truck k*ller?

Man, I got bigger worries than that sick sh*t.

Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?

I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what you're after.

Oh, hell, no.

But my landlord's another f*cking story--

Trying to kick me out of my home.

Shanda.

He got no cause, except he's a born-again hypocrite m*therf*cker.

Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?

No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.

Morgan. Found this in evidence.

Masuka was gonna grease it through.

A cigarette butt?

Jesus, we could pull DNA off of that, or even a print.

Except it would be your print.

You were smoking on a crime scene.

Not on the crime scene-- like on the way-far end of the park.

The whole area's a crime scene. You should know that by now.



Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.



Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.



Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.



Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.



I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.
Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...



...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?



¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.



And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.



If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.



Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.



So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.
Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...



...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?



¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.



And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.



If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.



Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.



So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.
Previously on "Dexter"...

Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.

Hey, Angel, I got him!

They really found the ice-truck k*ller?

I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.

Son of a b*tch.

I have so many questions for him.

What was his message to me?

Now I need to know him.

Hi.

The f*ck are you?

Paul Bennett. Father on parole.

Dexter Morgan.

I can't think of anything clever to say.

Divorce papers -- Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I'd better make the most of them.

Your instincts were dead-on.

They're always dead-on when it comes to K*llers. Why is that?

I'm watchin' you.

What are we looking at here?

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

You?

No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?

Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you?

I like seafood.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

Not as hard as her.

Damn power outages.

I don't know, Angel.

Most firearm suicides are committed by men.

Women tend to slash their wrists, take pills, something more ladylike.

Not in Miami.

We closed a couple of su1c1de cases just like this last year, remember?

Look at this mess.

That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?

House husband. And aspiring artist.

Promising.

So, she supported him?

It looks like that.

She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

Those other suicides we closed -- those were high-powered women too, right?

I don't know. I think so.

Note to self.

I don't care what it looks like. Somebody k*lled her.

We're checking out all the possibilities, Mr. Gayle.

Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem?

You know, job stress, the usual, but she was working through it in therapy.

She have any other problems that you're aware of? Threats?



Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.



I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.



It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.



You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.



Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?



To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.



You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪
♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪
♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪
♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.
Previously on "Dexter"...

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No, he's got unfinished business with me. "Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."

Paul called after you left.

He's already out of jail -- Overcrowding.

Can you believe it?

Are you f*cking my wife?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

I just wish he'd go away.

Why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you to.

It's different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love. "Barbie, be patient. "One day we'll share a cold one."

Thank god for showers. Private time to think --

Harder to come by now that I'm in a real relationship.

Do you mind?

Not at all.

Could you pass the soap?

Yeah.

It's locked!

Mom, I got to pee!

I'll be right there, sweetie!

Hold on a second, buddy!

I can't!

Sorry. One-bathroom house.

Nature calls.

Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?

Cody!

Sword fight -- I won.

Mom, I got to brush.

Whatever happened to knocking?

I'm gonna be late for school.

You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna...

I mean, what does "separation" mean to you?

What "separation" means to me is that you're separated, and you work it out. Now, this was false pretenses.

I mean, I knew she wanted a divorce when she asked for the separation -- she lied.



Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.



I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...



And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.



Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.



If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.



Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.



Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.
Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.



Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.



Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.



But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.



I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.Previously on "Dexter"...

You still don't remember anything from before?

You know, before we took you in?

No.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

Mama!

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad.

And this is Rudy.

Dexter.

Hey.

I have waited a long time to meet you.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell's this guy thinking?

And the real king is still out there.

Hungry. Ready.

He'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think --

I'm falling for him.

Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

No!

f*cking whore!

Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday.

Can't be late Monday. Throws the whole week off.

What about breakfast?

Made and eaten.

And the kids' lunches?

Packed and ready to go.

Did you tell the locksmith?

Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven-pin keyways.

I want to talk to your mom for a sec.

Are you gonna make out?

None of your business.

Are you?

Astor.

Rita, you don't have to do this, you know.

Getting att*cked by your ex-husband merits a day off.

I'm fine.

I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore.

Those days are over.

It's gonna be okay. The police have been notified.

They'll find him.

What if they don't?

I got you some pepper spray.

Just aim for the eyes.

Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

I had some at Kirk's birthday,

10 days ago.

See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here.

Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think.

It started out vanilla.

Guys, you should look at this.

Put that thing down, for God's sake.

It was addressed to Homicide.

Put it down!

Jesus, is that blood?

Morgan, get your a*s over here.

a*s en route.

You're the blood expert. What is this sh*t?

It's a little watery for jam.

Maybe you should open it.

What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released?

I got to wash my hands.

So gullible.

What is it?

Well, it's definitely blood.

Wait, there's something in here.

Marina View hotel.

It's a key.

May be some sort of promotional gag.

You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood.

Show-and-tell's over.

Let's try and find out who sent this.

Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.

Batista's still working on the expl*si*n at the smack lab.

Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.

A jar of blood --

Dramatic, cryptic, playful.

Could it be him?

Got an extra key from the manager.

Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.

The guy who checked into 103

was white and normal looking.

I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here.

It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security.

Better be ready to cancel your lunch.

Police. Open up.

Oh, my God. Jesus. Get back in your room.

Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8

out at the Marina View hotel.

I need uniformed backup, forensics.

f*ck it. Just send everybody out.

It's been a while since we went prophylactic.

Not me. Last night, I met this chick --

I'll stop you right there, Vince.

So, they tell you anything about what's inside?

No one's been inside. Too much blood.

Dexter.

Just a heads-up -- It's bad in there.

Okay.

I'm serious.

Okay.

She's not kidding. It's your wet dream in there.

Okay.

You're going in first alone.

Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report. Don't f*ck up.

Now I'm really curious.

He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me?

Mommy!

Tell me you found something, Morgan.

I talked to the guests in room 105.

They didn't see anyone go in or out.

What about across the hall?

German tourists. They got their head up their lederhosen.

They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming.

Oh, my god!

Hey. Hey, you okay?

I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there.

Never should have skipped breakfast.

Bullshit. You're shaking. What the hell happened up there?

No, I'm okay. I just need a little air.

Something finally got to you.

I guess you're human after all.

Cut him some slack, all right?

I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar.

Tell us what you saw, Dex.

How many dead?

A lot.

But no bodies, just blood --

50, 60 liters.

Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know.

You're saying there was a mass m*rder in there, but they took the bodies?

How is that possible?

There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms.

Someone would have seen corpses coming out.

I don't f*cking know.

Hey, Dexter, you all right?

I can't go back in there.

You don't have to.

Fine.

Just get yourself cleaned up and --

I don't know -- Work from the hallway or something.

You're in room 422.

Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags.

Dade county sheriff's department.

I'm looking for Rita Bennett.

That's me. Did you find Paul?

I'm sorry?

Paul Bennett.

My ex-husband att*cked me last night.

My boyfriend filed a police report.

The only report we have is the one that Mr. Bennett filed.

What? Wait.

Paul filed a police report? For what?

as*ault. Your ex-husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital.

He's pressing charges against you.

He att*cked me!

Not according to him.

All right. Can we talk about this later?

We need a formal statement.

You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station.

Fine.

Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from. All right?

Sweet.

You should really get in here, Dex.

I never seen anything like this.

Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts.

Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue. Come see.

Photos, Vince.

Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting?

The blood's not clotting?

No.

Genuine medical mystery.

Just keep getting samples.

I'll test it at the lab.

Hello? Don't hang up.

Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station.

Paul's pressing as*ault charges against me.

How's it even possible? I was defending myself.

Just stay calm. I know a lawyer.

I'll straighten it out.

I am calm.

They're the hysterical ones.

They're charging me with a class-2 felony.

Hello, Dexter? Are you there?

Yeah, I'm right here.

This is ridiculous.

I could lose my job. I could lose my kids.

I won't let that happen.

Well, I'm glad you're so confident.

Rita, just trust me.

I know how the system works.

Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.

You okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Thank you.

Yeah, bye.

Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out.

What? A wall socket?

Yeah.

Of course there's a wall socket. There's lots of wall --

Hey, you're right.

There was something plugged in here -- probably a power tool to cut them up.

Come take a look.

Photos, Vince.

Lots and lots of photos.

Open Sesame.

Blood samples for the fridge.

And you better make room. There's a lot more coming.

sh**t at the Bel Canto tonight. You in?

I'm not in the mood.

Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central.

Look at this.

They were for Nina's birthday -- backstage passes to Neil Diamond.

You're in worse shape than I thought.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

Oh, Masuka was looking for you.

Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.

Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection.

A bit of an overshare.

You want to talk about what happened today?

Already did.

Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died.

Can talk to me, you know?

Just got to open your mouth and move it.

I'll call Rudy. I'll tell him I'll be late.

Deb, seriously.

I puked.

I'm fine.

I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do.

Why do you always do this?

Do what?

You shut me out!

Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you.

I still don't know how that makes you feel.

I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call.

Fine.

Whatever.

Did Paul force his way into the house?

No.

Did you ask him to leave?

Yes, and he refused.

But in your statement, it says you invited your ex-husband into your bedroom.

He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading --

Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

And you didn't want it to escalate. I understand that, but we can't prove intent.

Your ex-husband has the injuries here, not you.

Paul has a record of spousal abuse.

Spousal abuse can be mutual.

It was never mutual.

Okay.

But the man is a model parolee.

His drug tests are clean.

He's got glowing reports from the court-appointed supervisor.

Corrections will want to see this guy transition.

I don't care!

He's not going near my children. Do you understand?

Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children.

Now, you have deposition in two days.

Do not give this man any more amm*nit*on than he already has.

Okay.

Damn.

Just blood?

What happened to the bodies?

Hell if I know.

I don't want to know.

Blood was bad enough.

No wonder you seem so amped.

Your brother must have loved it.

f*ck no. He freaked.

Really?

I thought, you know, blood was his thing.

What happened?

I don' know. It was like usual. He shut me out.

Did he say anything?

Let's not talk about Dex right now.

Was it like a panic attack?

I don't know.

He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.

Kiss me.

What's the matter? You don't even have wood.

Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk.

Yeah, but not now. I'm horny.

Maybe I should call him.

Are you f*cking kidding me?

What? We -- We bonded last weekend.

Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family?

Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants.

Deb, that's not fair.

You take me out on a -- couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn?

I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.

You know what?

Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.

Okay. I'm gonna go watch  TV.

She loved him so g*dd*mn much.

She took every one of his CDs in the separation.

She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits.

Nina loved Neil Diamond. "Song Sung Blue." "September Morn."

Oh, my god -- "Kentucky Woman."

You got to love that sh*t.

That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.

Waitress! Is there a waitress?

I need a drink. Waitress!

Bro, you're a train wreck.

Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce.

I ain't ashamed.

Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.

Look...

Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask.

Comprendo?

Eighty-six the ring.

I have to take a squirt.

She's gonna f*ck me silly.

My sister's right. I don't share my problems with her...

Or with anybody.

Harry taught me that -- Secrecy, self-reliance, and a well-stocked cupboard of hefty bags.

Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage...

Until that boy in the blood.

He scares me. I want him to go away.

You awake?

What?

Are you sure you locked the door?

Yeah, I'm positive -- Bolt and chain.

What am I gonna do?

Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

And I will.

I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own.

Fortunately, Rita's has a name.

Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103



left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.



One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.



Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.



You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.



So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.



I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --



Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.
Previously on "Dexter"...

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

It's Paul. He...

He violated Florida's three-strikes law.

The cops picked him up totally strung out on heroin.

He's back in jail.

Holy sh*t! They're f*cking fingertips.

He started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

Menthol?

Like cough drops.

I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he...

Son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

I was confused because I love you.

What did you say?

I love you.

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

No, it's -- I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.

I need an ambulance at

1228 Calendar Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.

The same images running through my head over and over.

I was there.

I saw my mother's death.

A buried memory, forgotten all these years.

It climbed inside me that day.

And it's been with me ever since --

My dark passenger.

You should be focusing on me, socio.

Seriously want to get the m*therf*cker that did this to Batista.

I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.

How's he doing? Do we know?

Still in surgery.

Laguerta's there.

God, I hate feeling so helpless.

What, no jokes about providing gross sexual comfort in a time of crisis?

Our friend was stabbed...

And he might die.

Officer Morgan.

What do you think, Dex?

He put up a fight. There was a struggle.

Attaboy, Angel.

Here, this trail --

Steady stream of drops.

He had a few seconds. Tried to move away until -- till he fell.

So much blood.

What's happening to me?

No way.

You're the one I'm supposed to meet.

In the flesh.

You know, I was just talking to someone about you.

That tickles.

Don't stop.

I wouldn't dream of stopping.

You're so different this time --

Gentle.

Are you gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again?

Actually, your...

...imperfection is what saved you the first time.

Saved me from what?

True artistry.

The message of my work is -- not in the product itself, but rather the presentation.

That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.

It's quite unsightly, actually.

Hey, you don't have to be an as*h*le about it.

Hey, hey, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to offend.

Truthfully...

I'm thankful for you.

You're my escape plan.

Escape from what?

The police.

Because of you, I've had to speed up my... project.

I need something to distract them by.

And I always found a freshly chopped-up body always does the trick.

Wait, wait! No!

Don't struggle.

That never helps.

I'm compressing your carotid artery, and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.

In about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.

Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.

Okay, I guess you went to bed.

Or you fell asleep on the couch watching "Xena" reruns, which I still think makes you a dork.

Either way, call me when you get this, okay?

Miss you.

He's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.

So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.

No. I mean, I can't.

Alright. I understand.

You need to be there for your friend.

I haven't told the kids yet.

Told them about Angel?

No, about Paul...

Being back in prison?

I hate breaking their hearts. They think so much of their dad now.

Right.

You know what?

Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.

Thanks.

They're actually coming out right now. I got to go.

Angel sustained severe internal injuries.

He lost a lot of blood.

But... the surgery was successful.

It looks like our boy's out of the woods.

I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.

But I can't focus.

I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

I need to know what it means.

Morgan.

What the f*ck is wrong with you?

I have someplace I have to be.

Well, we all got someplace to be.

But you just found out that somebody who was supposed to be your friend is gonna live.

Does that make you feel anything?

Anything at all?

Take your f*cking hand off me.

Just what I always thought.

Right.

♪ Deck the halls with parts of bodies ♪
♪ La-da-da-da dum ♪

sh*t. Just what I need.

Hey.

I know it's late.

I guess you didn't get my message.

I drove by and saw your car.

I can go.

Get your a*s in here.

It's about time you see where I live anyway.

You have no idea how much I needed this.

You feel good.

And cold. You're freezing!

Well, then stay and keep me warm.

This Batista thing has gotten to you, hasn't it?

Angel's daughter was there.

That's got to be rough.

Daughter of a cop --

Just like you.

Yeah.

I remember what that's like --

Kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.

Let's get out of town for the weekend --

Just the two of us.

We need to talk.

I'm sitting right here.

Nope.

The time has got to be right.

Okay.

It'll have to wait...

At least till we catch the as*h*le who did this to Batista.

Let me warn you -- I can be very persistent.

I need to get out of town, and I need you... to come... with me.

What I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.

I'm totally wired from all this sh*t.

Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.

My loving arms.

And...

I got a little thing to help you sleep.

That ain't no little thing.

I meant Valium.

It's one of the perks working at the hospital.

Wine and Valium?

I'll be totally helpless.

You read my mind.

Well, as I live and breathe!

You miss me?

You and the bear claws you're hiding behind your back.

This must be important.

Haven't seen much of you lately.

No rest for the wicked.

How's Gene?

Good days and bad.

He just finished his first round of radiation.

Well, he's a good guy.

Not much of a bridge player, though.

Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and I would take them to the cleaners.

I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.

Well, sure thing.

Got a date?

Not exactly.

It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

I wish I could help, but... everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basement at City Hall.

And... as you can see, I'm up to my you-know-what in year-end reports, so...

It's my lieutenant.

Camilla, is there anything you remember?

What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his home and give you a loving family.

I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.

Who found the body parts?

I did.

They were left under the tree.

I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around...

Till I found the head.

I told him not to touch anything, but he never listens.

God, Patty, you're such a b*tch.

Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary before you found the body?

There were some broken ornaments by the tree.

Who could do something like this so close to Christmas?

The Grinch.

Oh, you're a f*cking riot, Max!

Like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this.

There go our jobs.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Oh, sucks to be an elf.

...Get some visual surveillance.

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim. Cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

Yep. And after the bloodbath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the press on this one.

James!

Yeah?

I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.

And will somebody turn off this g*dd*mn snow machine?!

Your sister can help you out.

That a whole sexual-tension thing or am I missing something?

103.

It's the same numbers he left at Marina View hotel.

Any leads as to what they mean?

We've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers

-- Nothing.

They need more to go on.

First he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.

Now he leaves me this --

A calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.

It doesn't make sense.

Crime scene's wiped clean.

Another hooker?

Ho, ho, ho -- Another dead ho.

Somebody's been naughty.

Hey, Morgan.

Want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for Christmas?

And he's back!

No, thanks.

Last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.

This doesn't seem right.

Body parts scattered among the presents.

Broken ornaments.

It's not his usual meticulous style.

It seems rushed...

Haphazard.

That would explain why we can't find one of the hands.

What's wrong?

There's something underneath the torso.

Merry Christmas, Miami.

After all this time, why do you think the ice-truck k*ller has struck again?

Any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.



Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?



None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?



After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.



Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.
Previously on "Dexter"...

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim, cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Dexter...

Laura Moser...

My mother.

Laura Moser and 3 others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

Angel was stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place.

You really don't want to do this.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

Yes, yes, yes.

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Where the f*ck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.

I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

I've lived in darkness a long time.

Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I don't have much time -- or, to be more accurate, my sister doesn't have much time.

He wants me to find him, but where do I look?

I can't think.

It's too bright.

Let me know if the tape's too tight.

You know, there's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

Why are you doing this?

Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.

Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Shh, I'm just checking the supplies, okay?

Things are moving a little faster than I had planned.

This isn't you.

Pretty sure it is.

No!

I know there's more -- I've seen it.

I never wanted to hurt you.

I know. I know.

Does this make it easier for you? Because I can keep going.

Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!

There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb. I mean, you're not the only one who bought it, okay?

Your name isn't even f*cking Rudy Cooper, is it?

Nope...

But he died for a good cause.

Yeah, so will you.

You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

Not some invisible hooker -- you kidnapped a cop!

It's all part of the plan.

Oh, Jesus.

It's hard to believe it's almost come to fruition.

I mean, this is a lot of years in the making.

We're only hours away.

He wouldn't have taken Deb unless he left me everything a clever monster would need in order to find them.

♪ Born free, ♪
♪ As free as the wind blows ♪
♪ As free as the grass grows ♪
♪ Born free to follow your heart ♪

Seems I have a new screen saver.

I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded, but "Born free"?

Of course.

Thanks to Rudy, now I know where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

Born free of all that's human --

That's where I'll find him.

She knows.

She knows.

All f*cking night with that.

She knows.

Listen, Angel, we need your help.

Masuka says you were following up a lead on the ice-truck k*ller when you were att*cked.

A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

John painted her nails different colors, but it didn't go nowhere.

Except she was just cut up by the ice-truck k*ller.

Holy sh*t. Monique was a victim?

Now, we're operating on the theory that he found out you were on his trail.

And if we're right, that means you got stabbed for a reason. It wasn't no carjacking.

How did he know it was me?

No one knew what I was doing except Masuka.

Someone else had to know. Think.

I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.

But that's crazy, right?

No, she's been AWOL since going out last night to meet him.

She was supposed to come back and help me canvass, but she never made it.

That's not like her.

Angel, we got to go.

Go, just go.

There are roughly 5,000 cargo containers in the port of Miami.

Finding the one where my mother was butchered took a bit of magic.

Busted.

Busted.

sh*t.

Just a second!

I told you he was here.

There some reason you're not answering your damn phone?

Ambien.

What happened here, Dexter?

I couldn't find the remote.

Where's your sister?

She didn't come back to work, and she's not at her apartment.

I honestly don't know, sergeant.

Dexter...

We think her boyfriend Rudy's connected to the ice-truck k*ller.

We're working on getting a search warrant right now to search his home.

No. Wow...

Cut the crap.

You know something. What?

James!

I saw him last night, skulking in the lab, ordering secret blood tests.

What kind of tests?

I was looking for a type match on the blood on Batista's collar.

And whose was it?

Rudy's.

m*therf*cker.

Knock it off!

He knew all along!

Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.

Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

It was just a wild hunch.

Why didn't you tell us?

I couldn't destroy Deb's love life on a hunch.

I had to get the facts.

Here are the facts: if he kills her, it's your fault. Now, what else do you know?

That's it.

He's lying.

Give him a break, James. It's his sister, all right?

Well, if he knows what's good for her, he'll sit his a*s at home and answer the f*cking phone when it rings.

Call if you hear anything.

Hello?

Please don't hang up.

Paul?

The kids don't want to talk to you, all right?

You got to give them more time.

This isn't about them.

It's about how I was arrested.

Yeah, with a needle in your arm -- I know all about it.

Well, I don't.

Listen, I take responsibility for all the sh*t I pulled, but, Rita, I was in the program.

I kicked the hard stuff.

Well, apparently not.

I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.

It's been driving me nuts how I got -- from your house one minute to the motel room the next, completely out of my mind on junk.

Yeah, it's called a blackout, Paul.

It's called a setup.

Well done.

The last thing I remember was standing in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

Now, he could have smacked me over the head and dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.

You really are a piece of work.

I'm telling you --

Dexter is not who you think he is.

Hello?

This one, I've got to make sure we got about seven copies of these.

I want to make sure it's distributed to everyone, okay?

Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.

Some of you may have met him.

He was dating officer Morgan.

Now, she was last seen 16 hours ago, driving to meet him at the Miami Beach marina.

So we need to canvass the entire area.

Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

I've already sent a team over to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

The judge just signed off on the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

Well, let's tear that place apart.

Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

Your attention, please.

I want to introduce you to our new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.

She agreed to put her vacation on hold, come in early, to provide us with some much-needed leadership at this critical time.

Lieutenant, you're on.

I understand we have a new suspect in the ice-truck k*ller case.

We're on our way over now to search his place.

And you are...

Maria Laguerta.

And we have an officer missing, so we need to move fast.

I thought that sergeant Doakes was running that investigation.

He's out following a lead.

What lead?

He said he'd let me know if it came to anything. Now if you excuse me --

I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

Who here can get me up to speed on the way over?

I can, I guess.

You're driving.

And feel free to join us when you locate your partner.

Would you like to come with us, captain?

You seem to have everything under control.

Let's go, people.

It's in there somewhere --

My birthplace.

Now what?

No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

With billions spent on Homeland Security, it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

So much for the w*r on terror.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

I don't like this place.

Something nameless was born here...

Something that lives in the deepest, darkest hole of the thing called "Dexter."

Get in there!

Somebody else -- Get in there now!

It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

Nothing will hurt you -- I promise.

Okay, Deb... don't be dead.

sh*t.

Surprise, m*therf*cker.

Are you following me now?

You better have a hell of a reason for being here.

I'm looking for my sister.

In a cargo box?

Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.

You forget you work for the f*cking cops?

We love theories. Spin me a story, as*h*le.

What I do on my time is my business, sergeant.

Yeah, me too, and I'm on my time now.

There's no lieutenant here to save your a*s, so don't f*ck with me, Morgan!

All right, you got me.

I ordered some furniture from Thailand.

I was waiting for it to be delivered.

Lab geek -- My a*s.

Hey, what the hell's going on over here?!

Security, I need to get somebody down here right now.

Miami metro P.D.

Yeah Is this guy under arrest?

That's a good question.

You're connected to this.

I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your a*s.

Let me out of here, m*therf*cker!

Let me out of here!

Let me out! Let me out! Let me out, you piece of sh*t!

Let me out of here, you f*cking piece -- Aah!

f*ck! Let me out!

Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio, and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

Bye!

His happy place, where he kills more than time --

This is where he'd leave me a clue.

Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.

I like the cold.

You know, hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.

Yeah, and so can hypochondria.

And a home setup like this would take years to put together.

He must have hated leaving it behind.

What are you looking for?

A clue, signature or calling card --

Anything that might give us a sense of where he went.

Well, I don't think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this.

I mean, look at this place.

Hey, you were right about the victim at Santa's cottage.

He rushed his work.

He k*lled that girl to keep us busy so he could escape, but he wouldn't go without leaving us a message.

We just need to find it.

Check this out.

This is where he played with his meat.

Pretty whacked out, huh?

I can think of 101

uses for this table.

Know what I mean?

He has my sister, Vince.

Right.

I mean -- I didn't mean -- I'm sorry.

sh*t.

You're Karen, right?

That's right.

You're in charge of evidence -- this entire room -- evidence.

Take photos of every item in its original position: work-kit, packages...

Show me the inventory list when you're done.

Is he in charge?

Guess he is now.

Rita?

Rita?

Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

Can I help you?

I guess Paul never mentioned me.

I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

Right.

So, having your sponsor do your dirty work --

Which step is that?

See, he's -- he's just concerned for the kids.

No, he's concerned for himself. If you'll excuse me...

I thought he was lying, too, until I saw the proof.

What proof?

Well, the X-rays the prison doctor took of Paul's head --

They showed a skull fracture.

Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

No. You didn't.

See, after you struck him, the hospital took X-rays -- No fracture.

But in prison, a fracture.

If you know Paul, you'd know he'd bash his own head against the wall to get what he wants.

Well, I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.



No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!



The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.



His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.Previously on "Dexter"..

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again.

Has to happen.

There he is. He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

You better be a cop.

No... Forensics.

There is no blood near the body at all.

It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

One of these days, you're gonna tell me.

I told you blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

How the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Please, you have to understand.

Trust me. I definitely understand.

Hello?

What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

They found another hooker.

Another one?

That's the third one in five months.

Third? You mean there's a...

Serial k*ller, that's right.

Dex, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Of course, you have to learn how to spot them, but I can teach you.



The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.



I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...



Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.



Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".



Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.



Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.Previously on "Dexter"...

What happened changed something inside you, Dex.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

What can I do to help?

No blood. What a beautiful idea.

Refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "hey, want to play?"



Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.



We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.



Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.



Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.



As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?



Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.



However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.
Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood. What a gorgeous idea.

Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold environment... to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man. You did... when you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam. You in?

Hey, man. Sounds good.

I thought you said you wanted to go get sh*t-faced.

I am sh*t-faced.

I showed my face to Guerrero, to his whole church.

They're gonna think I'm behind this sh*t.

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

He's escalating the thrill, posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show us what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Fingertips.

f*ckin' as*h*le, that's my girl.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

I find people around me are always making some kind of connection, like friendship or romance, but human bonds always lead to messy complications... commitment, sharing, driving people to the airport.

Besides, if I let someone get that close,

So, time to put on my mask.

I need your expertise.

I live to serve.

Excuse us, fellas.

Interesting hand job.

That's funny.

It is?

So, how long you think it's been there?

This feels familiar.

Okay. So, how long has it been there?

Blood stopped pooling, still wet... couple hours at the most.

What time was it found?

A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.

No prints. Wiped clean. Real creep show, huh?

Any sign of the rest of the body?

Just Mr. Hand. Do you think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

It's hard to say. There's blood. That's different.

Plus, it's a male victim-- haven't seen that before.

The cut appears to be almost delicate.

You see between the first and second row of carpals...

Very surgical.

Check out what else he left behind.

A little postcard to remember him by.

How far is Rand Beach from here?

This is Rand Beach.

It was renamed Petrie Beach a few years ago.

Okay, everybody.

Everybody say "stinky feet".

Stinky feet!

Wait. Nobody move. Dexter, were you smiling?

No.

Okay, we'll do another one.

This time, everybody smiles. You, too, Dex.

Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.

Shut your damn face, Deb.

Hey, language, please.

What? She always talks like that.

Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.

What's your problem?

I hate the beach.

It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.

Too bad. You're part of a family.

And being part of a family means smiling for photos.

Why should I pretend I'm happy?

Because it'll make your mom happy, and because it's how you fit in.

Remember we talked about that?

Yeah.

This is how you do it.

When somebody takes your picture, you smile.

It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

You just do it to fit in. Okay?

Okay.

All right.

Come here, handsome.

Okay. Everybody ready? One more time.

Stinky feet!

Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.

Straight to the station after, yeah. Thanks, lieutenant.



Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...



Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.



Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...



Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.



Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...



And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.Previously on "Dexter"...

Think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

It's the guard-- Tucci.

I think he's alive.

Tucci's alive?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

He's sending me a message.

He wants me to go there.

Please.

He was left here so I would k*ll him.

Just k*ll me.

I can't k*ll this man.

Taking Tucci over to County alive.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

The thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be. I'm Dexter.

I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone, maybe post-apocalypse or plague, Whatever-- No one left to act normal for, no need to hide who I really am.

It would be

...freeing.

Stop grinning like a f*cking psycho and get back to work.

Sorry, sergeant.

I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before I tear the bed apart.

I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

My shadow companion chose this place well.

This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.

All these people pawing over it seems...

He was here for days, playing with sharp objects.

I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless, amazingly so.

The only blood I found belongs to the security guard.

Has he said anything yet?

Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

Lieutenant, up here!

There's got to be something here. Find it.

The guy's not a ghost. Tony Tucci is evidence of that.

Hey, Dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet?

It's like sh**ting a Jackson Pollock.

Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.

Ready?

Okay.

What was that?

Did you see that?

What?

Damn rats.

We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their sh*t in the dust.

We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.

Lovely. Can we get the lights, guys?

You ever heard of rat-bite fever?

Masuka, what'd I say about the f*cking rats?

You haven't found anything, won't find anything.

This is a bust, right?

In so many words.

Which means I'm just jerking off till Tucci wakes up.

So take a break. You've been working this thing 24-7.

Or are you still avoiding a personal life?

Oh, f*ck you.

And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.

Thanks, guys.

It doesn't have to be either/or.

Maybe not for you.

If I found someone, so can you, right?

Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

Tell me about it.

Yelina? Are you okay?

I'm sorry. I'm fine.

Ernesto hasn't arrived?

I'm sure he'll be here soon.

No.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Coyote?

You mean the man you paid to bring him here?

He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.

But that was a week ago, and no one in Cárdenas has heard from Ernesto.

Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

...This was his number, but it's not working anymore.

I was supposed to leave him money in a park.

Listen, my boyfriend works for the police. I'm sure he--

No, no, no. We can't go to the police.

He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba.

No, it's okay. It's okay. Dexter will know what to do.

I feel just terrible for her.

And they were supposed to be married after he got here.

I do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues.

I can talk to him.

That's really kind of you, Dex.

I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your fiancée is dead or alive?

Uh, no.

Every night after work Yelina goes across the street, to the beach.

I've seen her there, just... staring out at the water, willing him to walk out of it.

Have you ever longed for anything like that?

She wants something from me. Ever since the blow job, she assumes we've taken it to the next level.

She doesn't know yet-- I don't have a next level.

Well, when I was a kid, I would have k*lled for an Atari.

You know?

Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man...

It always comes to this once sex is introduced.

Small talk no longer cuts it.

Eventually she'll call me a science project and slam the door in my face.

But when do you think he'll wake up?

Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a k*ller out there that's into whores and security guards, but I'll bet nurses are next.

Yo, check you, all "MPD Blue".

Shanda, what are you doing here?

You have another lead on the ice-truck k*ller?

Man, I got bigger worries than that sick sh*t.

Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?

I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what you're after.

Oh, hell, no.

But my landlord's another f*cking story--

Trying to kick me out of my home.

Shanda.

He got no cause, except he's a born-again hypocrite m*therf*cker.

Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?

No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.

Morgan. Found this in evidence.

Masuka was gonna grease it through.

A cigarette butt?

Jesus, we could pull DNA off of that, or even a print.

Except it would be your print.

You were smoking on a crime scene.

Not on the crime scene-- like on the way-far end of the park.

The whole area's a crime scene. You should know that by now.



Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.



Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.



Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.



Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.



I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.
Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...



...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?



¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.



And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.



If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.



Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.



So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...



...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?



¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.



And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.



If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.



Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.



So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.

Hey, Angel, I got him!

They really found the ice-truck k*ller?

I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.

Son of a b*tch.

I have so many questions for him.

What was his message to me?

Now I need to know him.

Hi.

The f*ck are you?

Paul Bennett. Father on parole.

Dexter Morgan.

I can't think of anything clever to say.

Divorce papers -- Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I'd better make the most of them.

Your instincts were dead-on.

They're always dead-on when it comes to K*llers. Why is that?

I'm watchin' you.

What are we looking at here?

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

You?

No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?

Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you?

I like seafood.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

Not as hard as her.

Damn power outages.

I don't know, Angel.

Most firearm suicides are committed by men.

Women tend to slash their wrists, take pills, something more ladylike.

Not in Miami.

We closed a couple of su1c1de cases just like this last year, remember?

Look at this mess.

That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?

House husband. And aspiring artist.

Promising.

So, she supported him?

It looks like that.

She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

Those other suicides we closed -- those were high-powered women too, right?

I don't know. I think so.

Note to self.

I don't care what it looks like. Somebody k*lled her.

We're checking out all the possibilities, Mr. Gayle.

Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem?

You know, job stress, the usual, but she was working through it in therapy.

She have any other problems that you're aware of? Threats?



Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.



I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.



It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.



You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.



Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?



To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.



You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪
♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪
♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪
♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.Previously on "Dexter"...

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No, he's got unfinished business with me. "Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."

Paul called after you left.

He's already out of jail -- Overcrowding.

Can you believe it?

Are you f*cking my wife?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

I just wish he'd go away.

Why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you to.

It's different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love. "Barbie, be patient. "One day we'll share a cold one."

Thank god for showers. Private time to think --

Harder to come by now that I'm in a real relationship.

Do you mind?

Not at all.

Could you pass the soap?

Yeah.

It's locked!

Mom, I got to pee!

I'll be right there, sweetie!

Hold on a second, buddy!

I can't!

Sorry. One-bathroom house.

Nature calls.

Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?

Cody!

Sword fight -- I won.

Mom, I got to brush.

Whatever happened to knocking?

I'm gonna be late for school.

You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna...

I mean, what does "separation" mean to you?

What "separation" means to me is that you're separated, and you work it out. Now, this was false pretenses.

I mean, I knew she wanted a divorce when she asked for the separation -- she lied.



Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.



I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...



And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.



Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.



If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.



Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.



Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.Tonight's the night.



And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.



Nice night.



Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.



Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.



But I'm hungry for something different now.



There he is-- Mike Donovan.



He's the one.



You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.



What do you want?



I want you to be quiet.



Now drive.



Turn here.



You have to listen...



Do what I say.



Look.



No.



Uh, yes.



No, no!



It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?



Please...



Open your eyes and look at what you did!



Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.



It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.



One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.



I pulled him out in bits and pieces.



Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--



Stop! That never helped anybody.



Please, you can have anything.



That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?



I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--



Please, you have to understand...



Trust me, I definitely understand.



See, I can't help myself, either.



Children, I could never do that. Not like you.



Never, ever kids.



Why?



I have standards.



Soon you'll be packed into a few...



...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.



It'll be a neater, happier place.



I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.



People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.



Ahoy!



Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?



And that's my burden, I guess.



But I don't blame my foster parents for that.



Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.



But they're both dead now.



I didn't k*ll them...



Honest.



You're different, aren't you, Dexter?



What do you mean, pop?



The Billups say Buddy disappeared.



I found the grave, son.



That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.



He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.



And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!



There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.



Hola, Dexter!



Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.



Other times, it helps me control the chaos.



The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.



And so am I.



Harry was a great cop here in Miami.



He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.



I'm a very neat monster.



Dexter, are you there?



Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?



Dex? Please...



Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.



That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.



She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.



She's the only person in the world who loves me.



I think that's nice.



I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.



There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.



It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--



Dahmer Land*.



You better be a cop.



No. Forensics.



Dex!



Hey, what's up?



Jeez, Deb...



Where the hell do you keep your g*n?



They found another hooker, in the pool.



Another?



Chopped up in bits and pieces.



That's the third one in 5 months.



Third? You mean there's a--



A serial k*ller, that's right.



The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.



Any suspects?



Wish I knew.



I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.



God forbids she listens to what you have to say.



Tell me about it.



How does someone so dumb get so much power?



She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.



In what, a*s-kissing?



Politics.



I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.



You can't get so emotionally invested.



You always say that.



So did Dad.



Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."



I want out of Vice and into Homicide.



What can I do to help?



You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.



Only sometimes.



Well, see if you get one this time.



And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?



You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.



You just need a little more confidence.



All right, I'll take a look.



In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.



He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.



You're making me smarter already, see?



And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.



It'll help your cause.



That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.



Saw your sister.



Damn, looking hot.



Yeah, she should.



It's hot as hell out here.



So... Why are you here?



It's a crime scene.



Yeah.



But you do blood spatter.



So?



So?... There's no blood here.



What was that?



Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.



Hey, Angel, let's show him.



No blood.



No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.



Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.



What a beautiful idea!



How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?



It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.



She got a nice a*s, too.



Head is over there, if you want to take a look.



This is unique.



No sh*t.



And no prints, either.



I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.



Wonderful.



Very clean.



Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.



It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.



No, no. Look.



He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.



But this leg is in three pieces.



Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.



It's possible he got interrupted.



Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.



God help him.



No blood.



I can't think. I have to get out of here.



Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?



Hey, no blood... No trabajo.



I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.



But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.



Morning, Dex.



Morning.



Hey, Dex.



Hey, Sue. Dan.



How are the families?



Good. You?



See you at the next bloodbath?



Never miss a party.



Thanks.



Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.



But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.



Viva Miami.



Dex.



I like your other outfit better.



You're a sick bastard. Guess what.



Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.



Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.



I guess. So congrats!



So you got any ideas yet?



Nope.



Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.



I got to go.



Doughnut?



You keeping your fingernails clean?



Never leave home without my rubber gloves.



Good boy.



So, anything new?



One of these days you're gonna tell me.



I already told you.



Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.



I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.



You have a morbid sense of fun.



That's probably true.



You should find a pretty girl.



I found you.



Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.



Then who would I bring doughnuts to?



Angel, ¿una más?



Gracias.



De nada.



Just like me...



Empty inside.



Where the hell you been?



Crime scene.



What about these?



The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?



Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.



No, this is child's play. Messy work--



All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.



You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?



Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.



f*ck you.



Okay.



Is there something I can do?



You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.



You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?



I didn't know you were Jewish.



Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.



Don't even know why I need you.



Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.



Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.



Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.







Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.



You got it?



Okay. Sure.



I guess. But I should get over there.



Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.



I need it quick.



I'm on it, sergeant.



The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?



So this k*ller used a sword?



No.



Probably a very sharp knife.



Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.



It tells a story.



You see this big pond of blood right there?



That's from the initial s*ab.



The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?



Yeah, nice.



Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.



No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.



This guy knew how to use a blade.



So we're looking for a sushi chef.



Yeah, sushi chef is possible.



Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.



Now what?



Now I eat!



The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.



It's a matter of public safety.



But there's always a sacrifice.



This guy, Jamie Jaworski.



Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--



A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--



All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.



The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.



It's a good thing I don't bother with them.



Animals don't like me, especially dogs.



I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.



That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.



Interesting taste in literature.



His needs are evolving, turning violent.



He's on the fast track.



Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?



You know, something bigger than a dog?



Yes.



Like a person?



Yeah, but no one in particular.



Why didn't you?



I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.



Come here.



Friday night. Date night in Miami.



Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.



But for me, sex never enters into it.



I don't understand sex.



Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.



But I have to play the game.



And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.



Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.



She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.



I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.



I have to change.



Okeydoke.



Hi, Dexter.



May I say that you look lovely this evening?



Okay.



Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.



Do the space shuttle.



Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.



No coffee?



Which one do you think melts faster?



Ready?



Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.



Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.



That works for me.



Will you be back?



Of course I'll be back.



I meant Dexter.



You'll be asleep.



No, I won't.



Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.



Texas Hold 'em?



Give mommy a kiss.



Ready?



Yeah.



Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.



Normal people are so hostile... But not her.



Where are we going?



They might need me.



Just stay right there. I'll be right back.



Son of a whore.



Who?



Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.



Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.







Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?



I have my needs.



So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?



I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.



A date? Nice.



Same guy, same pattern.



Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.



There's some small differences in the cuts this time.



Over here-- rough, almost emotion.



Then over here, not so much.



And then over here-- clean.



Muy bien.



Yeah, nice. But look at this.



All bone.



The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.



Now, why would he do that?



He's experimenting.



He's trying to find the right way.



Is he experimenting with the head, too?



What do you mean?



La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.



I don't find anyone around here.



And God only knows what he's doing with it.



He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!



This guy is good.



Will they catch him soon?



I doubt it.



The k*ller is an artist.



What do you mean?



His technique... is incredible.



I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.



I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.



Damn it, Dexter.



What have I done now?



And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?



No blood.



Why did I touch her that way?



I need to get back to my work.



Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.



That's it. He's definitely the one.



Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.



But I have to wait.



I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.



Hey, Dad.



I can explain.



You and I had an understanding.



Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.



I do tell you, Dad.



The hell you do!



There's blood on this knife.



Animals. I find animals, that's all.



Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?



Yes!



I thought we had this under control.



You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?



No.



Is that why I have these urges?



What happened changed something inside you.



It got into you too early.



I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.



You're saying I'll be like this forever.



You're a good kid, Dex. You are.



Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.



Okay? We can't stop this.



But maybe...



We can do something to channel it.



Use it for good.



How could it ever be good?



Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.



Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.



Do you understand what I'm saying?



You're saying they deserve it.



That's right.



But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.



But I can teach you.



Dad...



It's okay, Dex.



You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.



Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.



Okay.



Preparation is vital.



No detail can be overlooked.



And the ritual is intoxicating.



Duct tape...



Rubber sheets...



Necessary tools of the trade.



You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.



Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.



It's a waste of time.



Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.



Jesus Christ, right.



Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?



She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.







But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.



And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.



He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.



So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.



I could be wrong.



So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?



Great.



You should try it sometime. You need a life.



Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.



I understand that.



It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."



Don't make me hit you.



Come on.



Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.



What's wrong with that?



You sound like mom.



I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.



What do you mean?



I heard the coroner say it last night.



He was talking about that dead... headless chick.



You got that look in your eye.



I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.



The pieces were cold.



But meat-packing cold.



Is that what cell crystallization means?



My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.



Dex. What are you thinking?



Sorry. That makes sense.



Cold.



It slows the flow of blood.



Why the hell is that important?



It's just a feeling.



That's not good enough.



I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.



They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.







I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--



Refrigerated truck.



What the f*ck are you talking about?



A refrigerated truck.



He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.



So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?



Probably a stolen one.



You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?



Are you nuts? In Miami?



Choir... kids... Just do something.



Just find my husband.



Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.



I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.



What do you care about that woman?



I don't. I was just--



You like when women cry? You like that?



What's your thing, psycho?



I was just heading to the briefing room.



You got no call to be in there, so flee.



Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.



I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.



It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.



He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.



How about we get started?



¿Encontráste algo?



Nada todavía.



Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.



Discúlpame.



You ready?



I'm gonna shame this b*tch.



Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.



Okay, settle down.



Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?



Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.



Lieutenant Laguerta?



Officer Morgan.



I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.



I have an idea, something in a different direction.



An idea?



Well, please, share it with us.



Cell crystallization.



Excuse me?



A little more confidence, please.



On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.



Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?



No, not ice-cream trucks.



A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...



...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.



That's very interesting, very creative.



Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?



We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.



Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?



But--



Just keep talking to all your hookers.



That's all for today.



What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.



But he didn't say they had to listen to you.



Well, right again.



So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.



Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.



Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.



What the hell?



What the f*ck?



Are you boning her?



No.



Oh, my god!



Deb, wait.



Shut up.



It had nothing to do with dr*gs.



L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.



I think sergeant Doakes is right.



I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.



Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.



It was a crime of passion.



The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.



He did him quick and got him out of the way.



But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.



That's who I'd look for.



Okay.



It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.



I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.



Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.



There's good money in that.



No security guards-- that's good.



f*ck!



Talk.



What do you mean?



I think you know what I mean.



No. Oh, god.



Talk to me about Jane Saunders.



Okay. I did her.



How?



In a movie-- snuff film.



But I'm not sorry.



Of course not.



No, I'm not sorry, either.



Hello?



Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.



I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.



So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?



I mean, I'm really--



All right. What are you doing now?



I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.



Okay, bye.



All in all, it was a good night.



One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.



No way!



Give us a minute.



Hanging in there?



This will teach me to tailgate.



Let's go over this again.



I'm all yours.



So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?



Sure, during business hours.



But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.



And you followed it.



That's right.



You never saw the driver?



Just high beams and a flying head.



So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.



That's weird. Why would he keep it there?



I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?



It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.



She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.



You know, you should call me Maria.



But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.



Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.



You were right. It was her boyfriend.



Of course, Doakes still hates you.



Of course.



Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?



Lots of sleep.



Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?



Sure thing. You're tired.



Good night, lieutenant.



I'll catch you later.



Dex. It's been a while.



I'm sorry.



I was worried.



I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.



I mean...



Are you okay?



Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--



I'm sorry. There was another... You know.



Look... The kids slept over next door.



Okay.



Would you like to come in?



Okay.



Okay.



I don't want to lose you, Dex.



Okay, sure.



And... well... I want you.



I mean...



Okay. Thanks.



You're welcome.



Do you mind?



No.



It could be the kids.



Better get it, then.



Hello?



Cody.



Cody, stop crying, sweetie.



All right. I'll come get you.



Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.



I got to go get him.



Tell me we're okay.



Better than.



Okay.



Go be a good mom.



Okay, that was close.



I'll admit, making out with Rita was...



Interesting.



But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.



I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.



No.



In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"



And, yes, I want to play.



I really, really do.
Previously on "Dexter"...



You still don't remember anything from before?



You know, before we took you in?



No.



What are you doing?



I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.



It might bring some things to the surface.



Mama!



It was a match.



Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad.



And this is Rudy.



Dexter.



Hey.



I have waited a long time to meet you.



Why the different nail polishes?



What the hell's this guy thinking?



And the real king is still out there.



Hungry. Ready.



He'll k*ll again.



It's just a matter of time.



Dex, Rudy's different.



I feel safe with him. I think --



I'm falling for him.



Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.



You think you can really make me back down?



Are you f*cking my wife?



The kids are already settled at Colleen's.



You can have your visit when we get back.



I just wish he'd go away.



I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?



No!



f*cking whore!



Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday.



Can't be late Monday. Throws the whole week off.



What about breakfast?



Made and eaten.



And the kids' lunches?



Packed and ready to go.



Did you tell the locksmith?



Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven-pin keyways.



I want to talk to your mom for a sec.



Are you gonna make out?



None of your business.



Are you?



Astor.



Rita, you don't have to do this, you know.



Getting att*cked by your ex-husband merits a day off.



I'm fine.



I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore.



Those days are over.



It's gonna be okay. The police have been notified.



They'll find him.



What if they don't?



I got you some pepper spray.



Just aim for the eyes.



Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.



I had some at Kirk's birthday,



10 days ago.



See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here.



Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think.



It started out vanilla.



Guys, you should look at this.



Put that thing down, for God's sake.



It was addressed to Homicide.



Put it down!



Jesus, is that blood?



Morgan, get your a*s over here.



a*s en route.



You're the blood expert. What is this sh*t?



It's a little watery for jam.



Maybe you should open it.



What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released?



I got to wash my hands.



So gullible.



What is it?



Well, it's definitely blood.



Wait, there's something in here.



Marina View hotel.



It's a key.



May be some sort of promotional gag.



You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood.



Show-and-tell's over.



Let's try and find out who sent this.



Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.



Batista's still working on the expl*si*n at the smack lab.



Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.



A jar of blood --



Dramatic, cryptic, playful.



Could it be him?



Got an extra key from the manager.



Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.



The guy who checked into 103



was white and normal looking.



I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here.



It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security.



Better be ready to cancel your lunch.



Police. Open up.



Oh, my God. Jesus. Get back in your room.



Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8



out at the Marina View hotel.



I need uniformed backup, forensics.



f*ck it. Just send everybody out.



It's been a while since we went prophylactic.



Not me. Last night, I met this chick --



I'll stop you right there, Vince.



So, they tell you anything about what's inside?



No one's been inside. Too much blood.



Dexter.



Just a heads-up -- It's bad in there.



Okay.



I'm serious.



Okay.



She's not kidding. It's your wet dream in there.



Okay.



You're going in first alone.



Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report. Don't f*ck up.



Now I'm really curious.



He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me?



Mommy!



Tell me you found something, Morgan.



I talked to the guests in room 105.



They didn't see anyone go in or out.



What about across the hall?



German tourists. They got their head up their lederhosen.



They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming.



Oh, my god!



Hey. Hey, you okay?



I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there.



Never should have skipped breakfast.



Bullshit. You're shaking. What the hell happened up there?



No, I'm okay. I just need a little air.



Something finally got to you.



I guess you're human after all.



Cut him some slack, all right?



I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar.



Tell us what you saw, Dex.



How many dead?



A lot.



But no bodies, just blood --



50, 60 liters.



Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know.



You're saying there was a mass m*rder in there, but they took the bodies?



How is that possible?



There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms.



Someone would have seen corpses coming out.



I don't f*cking know.



Hey, Dexter, you all right?



I can't go back in there.



You don't have to.



Fine.



Just get yourself cleaned up and --



I don't know -- Work from the hallway or something.



You're in room 422.



Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags.



Dade county sheriff's department.



I'm looking for Rita Bennett.



That's me. Did you find Paul?



I'm sorry?



Paul Bennett.



My ex-husband att*cked me last night.



My boyfriend filed a police report.



The only report we have is the one that Mr. Bennett filed.



What? Wait.



Paul filed a police report? For what?



as*ault. Your ex-husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital.



He's pressing charges against you.



He att*cked me!



Not according to him.



All right. Can we talk about this later?



We need a formal statement.



You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station.



Fine.



Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from. All right?



Sweet.



You should really get in here, Dex.



I never seen anything like this.



Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts.



Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue. Come see.



Photos, Vince.



Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting?



The blood's not clotting?



No.



Genuine medical mystery.



Just keep getting samples.



I'll test it at the lab.



Hello? Don't hang up.



Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station.



Paul's pressing as*ault charges against me.



How's it even possible? I was defending myself.



Just stay calm. I know a lawyer.



I'll straighten it out.



I am calm.



They're the hysterical ones.



They're charging me with a class-2 felony.



Hello, Dexter? Are you there?



Yeah, I'm right here.



This is ridiculous.



I could lose my job. I could lose my kids.



I won't let that happen.



Well, I'm glad you're so confident.



Rita, just trust me.



I know how the system works.



Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.



You okay?



Yeah.



Yeah, I'm okay.



Thank you.



Yeah, bye.



Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out.



What? A wall socket?



Yeah.



Of course there's a wall socket. There's lots of wall --



Hey, you're right.



There was something plugged in here -- probably a power tool to cut them up.



Come take a look.



Photos, Vince.



Lots and lots of photos.



Open Sesame.



Blood samples for the fridge.



And you better make room. There's a lot more coming.



sh**t at the Bel Canto tonight. You in?



I'm not in the mood.



Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central.



Look at this.



They were for Nina's birthday -- backstage passes to Neil Diamond.



You're in worse shape than I thought.



Oh, hi.



Hi.



Oh, Masuka was looking for you.



Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.



Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection.



A bit of an overshare.



You want to talk about what happened today?



Already did.



Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died.



Can talk to me, you know?



Just got to open your mouth and move it.



I'll call Rudy. I'll tell him I'll be late.



Deb, seriously.



I puked.



I'm fine.



I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do.



Why do you always do this?



Do what?



You shut me out!



Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you.



I still don't know how that makes you feel.



I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call.



Fine.



Whatever.



Did Paul force his way into the house?



No.



Did you ask him to leave?



Yes, and he refused.



But in your statement, it says you invited your ex-husband into your bedroom.



He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading --



Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.



And you didn't want it to escalate. I understand that, but we can't prove intent.



Your ex-husband has the injuries here, not you.



Paul has a record of spousal abuse.



Spousal abuse can be mutual.



It was never mutual.



Okay.



But the man is a model parolee.



His drug tests are clean.



He's got glowing reports from the court-appointed supervisor.



Corrections will want to see this guy transition.



I don't care!



He's not going near my children. Do you understand?



Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children.



Now, you have deposition in two days.



Do not give this man any more amm*nit*on than he already has.



Okay.



Damn.



Just blood?



What happened to the bodies?



Hell if I know.



I don't want to know.



Blood was bad enough.



No wonder you seem so amped.



Your brother must have loved it.



f*ck no. He freaked.



Really?



I thought, you know, blood was his thing.



What happened?



I don' know. It was like usual. He shut me out.



Did he say anything?



Let's not talk about Dex right now.



Was it like a panic attack?



I don't know.



He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.



Kiss me.



What's the matter? You don't even have wood.



Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk.



Yeah, but not now. I'm horny.



Maybe I should call him.



Are you f*cking kidding me?



What? We -- We bonded last weekend.



Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family?



Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants.



Deb, that's not fair.



You take me out on a -- couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn?



I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.



You know what?



Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.



Okay. I'm gonna go watch  TV.



She loved him so g*dd*mn much.



She took every one of his CDs in the separation.



She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits.



Nina loved Neil Diamond. "Song Sung Blue." "September Morn."



Oh, my god -- "Kentucky Woman."



You got to love that sh*t.



That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.



Waitress! Is there a waitress?



I need a drink. Waitress!



Bro, you're a train wreck.



Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce.



I ain't ashamed.



Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.



Look...



Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask.



Comprendo?



Eighty-six the ring.



I have to take a squirt.



She's gonna f*ck me silly.



My sister's right. I don't share my problems with her...



Or with anybody.



Harry taught me that -- Secrecy, self-reliance, and a well-stocked cupboard of hefty bags.



Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage...



Until that boy in the blood.



He scares me. I want him to go away.



You awake?



What?



Are you sure you locked the door?



Yeah, I'm positive -- Bolt and chain.



What am I gonna do?



Don't worry. I'll figure it out.



And I will.



I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own.



Fortunately, Rita's has a name.



Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103







left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --



The k*ller's.



This shows everywhere he went in the room.



The question is why.



Hold on.



Aren't we missing something?



Where are the victims' footprints?



Give that lady a lollipop.



Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?



Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?



And where'd he get the blood?



I've just got a preliminary blood report.



The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.



My fellow traveler had five victims.



Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.



5 bloodless victims.



I always wondered what he did with the blood.



Wait, wait.



The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.



Why would he do that?



To chase me down the rabbit hole.



What was that, Morgan?



I didn't say anything.



I'll remind you people --



We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.



His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.



Bullshit.



Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.



Try telling that to the capital.



I did.



Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?



When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.







One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.



It means the blood's old.



Plus the blood spatters'



all impact and castoff.



There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.



Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.



You two get out to the Marina View hotel.



Retrace his steps.



Maybe it'll tell us something.



And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.



All right, Astor, just stand up straight.



Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?



It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?



Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.



Rita?



You're scaring them.



Yeah, well, they should be.



I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.



What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?



I smelled gas.



I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.



Remember what the lawyer said.



You don't want to do anything rash.



Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.



Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.



Daddy, what happened?



Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.



Hey, we're going to the circus.



We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?



Good.



All right. Ready?



Got your stuff?



Let's go.



You okay?



I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.



If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.



All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.



Harry would have insisted on that.



Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.



After all, Harry wasn't perfect.



He lied about my birth father.



The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.



Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.



Mommy!



Hide your head, Dexter.



Close your eyes.



No!



So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...



And then over to the bedside table.



There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.



Maybe he turned it on.



No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.



We've been over it three times!



Well, maybe the map's wrong.



Call your brother.



What?



Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?



You don't even like him.



What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?



No, it's just...



It's Rudy.



We had our first fight.



Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.



I thought we were talking about your brother.



We were.



And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.



Turn that off.



No, wait. I want to hear it.



It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.



He said 103 fm. This is room 103.



Leviticus 10:3.



10:3 -- 103.



Son of a b*tch.



You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."



Hey.



Hey.



Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.



So you came here?



You know you know her better than anyone.



Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.



Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.



Right.



And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.



I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?



She's my sister. I don't know.



Can I help you find something?



You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.



Thanks.



Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.



Me?



Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.



So, what do I do?



Tell her it's all your fault.



Seriously?



You will eventually.



Deb has a way of wearing you down.



Just start from there. It's easier.



I got to take this. You mind if I...?



Hey. Where are you?



Still at work, chasing a lead.



Let me guess --



The bloodbath case.



I don't want to talk shop right now.



Baby, I am so sorry.



You were totally right.



I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.



My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?



I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.



Well, after.



Yeah, but here's the thing.



I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.



I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.



You understand, right?



Yeah.



I'll call you tomorrow.



Care to dance?



You dance to this?



A bit.



What about your wife?



Tan line on your ring finger.



Well, um...



I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.



Divorced? I get it.



Mine was just finalized.



Let's go.



Will you excuse me?



Excuse me.



Police. I need to talk to you.



I'm not a hooker anymore.



I work for a legitimate escort service now.



I'm not here to bust anyone.



I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.



He was a real good client.



You want to spend the night in a cell?



All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.



Guy or client?



A john, okay?



That's when I worked Calle Ocho.



Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.



Then what?



Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.



Told me to take my fake hand off.



He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.



To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.



I liked it, so I kept doing it.



You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?



Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?



Is that the guy?



No way.



My trick, he's sexy.



A freak, but sexy.



Okay.



From the beginning and with more detail.



Well, thanks for the hospitality.



Hey, thanks for the steaks.



You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.



Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.



Did she?



Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.



Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.







Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...



For real?



You know something about it?



More than I ever wanted to.



When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.



Who was she?



I didn't know.



Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...



My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.



I watched her die.



How old were you?



4.



I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.



Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.



What kind of memories are you having?



They're still a little vague.



Right.



Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.



Maybe next time.



When you see Deb, go with white roses.



They're her favorite.



That's a good tip.



It's funny how life brings people together, huh?



Rudy misunderstands my problem.



I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.



Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.



Like forgotten cellphones.



What do you got?



Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.



Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.



Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.



Screw the numbers.



Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?



I heard some pretty wild theories out there.



Just theories.



We're still waiting for full blood results.



Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.



I'm just trying to avoid speculation.



Well, you got to give me something and soon.



This department can't afford another public relations disaster.



Well...



Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.



He's not the ice-truck k*ller.



Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.



Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.



The D.A. takes his cues from us.



If you just tell him you made a mistake...



Not going to happen. Now let it go.



First break in this case, you come straight to me.



This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.



Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.



No, that's not what I mean.



So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?



Would you shut up?



It was a lead.



On what?



I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?



Oh, yeah.



Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.



But don't let them hear you call it that.



It sounds like a disease.



No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."



I knew you were the man to ask.



Not really.



I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.



You know who you should talk to?



It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.



Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.



Thanks.



No memory flashes here.



No little lost boy in blood.



Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.



Here's to hoping.



Yo, Dex.



Hey.



So, this is what you do for a living?



I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.



A power tool was used.



Here you go.



Oh, thanks.



Circular saw.



Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.



Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.







You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.



It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.



Yeah, I hear that.



But this power tool was plugged into a socket.



Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.



Come on, people. We're coming up empty.



Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.



We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.



Think.



1-0-3. 103.



Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.



What is it? I want answers.



What are you doing here?



How do you always do it?



Do what?



Make me feel like I'm 6



years old all the time.



If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.



Where'd he leave it?



My apartment.



What was he doing there?



Uh... eating steaks.



And?



Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.



And?



Debra.



And?



Talking?



Talking.



You talked.



You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.



On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.



Oh.



Yeah, "oh."



You don't talk to me, Dex.



You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.



But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --



They were porterhouses.



Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.



Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.







So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.



I think I have earned it.



I'm late for Rita's deposition.



Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.



You Rudy Cooper?



Angel Batista.



I work with your girlfriend, Debra.



Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.



I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.



Sure.



Let me just grab the door.



So, does this have to do with a case?



You could say that.



Well, fire away.



Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --



Call girl, actually.



Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.



You have a lead on this client?



That's the b*tch of it.



I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.



I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.







I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.



Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.



But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.



That'd be great.



How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?



You in a rush for this information?



No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.



Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.



Will do.



Good to meet you.



Good to meet you.



Last question.



According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.



That's right. His father died.



Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?



I told Paul I'd make it up to him.



So, then he gave you permission?



No.



I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.



I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.



Could you give us a second?



Yes, of course.



Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?



I didn't know it was a big deal.



I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...



No, that's fine.



If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.



Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.



It's mandatory in these cases.



The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.



For me?



But he's the ex-con.



It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.



Should be?



You mean she could actually lose this?



Guys...



I'm handcuffed here.



You violated a custody agreement.



You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.



He has a case.



Mama, look at my henna tattoo.



So, how much candy have you had?



Lots.



Thanks.



Now she'll never get to sleep.



She'll calm down soon.



This one's already crashed.



Mom, can my dad read me a story?



I don't think so, honey.



Please?



Okay.



But just one.



Put your duds on, buddy --



Spider-man ones I bought you.



I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.



Thanks, Betty. Thank you.



Hey, Rita.



It doesn't have to be this way.



I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?



I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.



f*ck you.



Hey, Dexy.



You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.



If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.



That won't happen.



Never say "won't."



We live in a world of wills --



Wills and wonders.



That's what I'm trying to teach my children.



And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.



Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?



Hey, I'm sober.



Look. No needle marks.



I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.



My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --







Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.



I think this is why.



Astor, go brush your teeth.



Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.



They were wrong.



Paul?



Dexter?



Where were you?



Taking out the trash.



Did you see Paul?



When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.



Hey, my dad's car is gone.



Let's face it, Paul.



You've been a problem.



It's time for you to go away.



The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.



Officially.



We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.



What about Neil Perry?



Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?



All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.



He's been personally handling the Perry case.



Oh, sh*t.



I hope she told the Captain.



Who knew?



Who knew about this?



This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.



The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.



Sure.



I'll call you back.



You overplayed your hand, Maria.



I gave you a chance to make it right.



I told you --



You don't tell me sh*t!



This is my department.



I made you lieutenant. Me.



You were just another spik detective.



Nice, Tom. Real nice.



Your true colors finally come out.



Oh, no.



No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.



But you're about to.



Enjoy this office while it's still yours.



Thank you.



Dexter.



What happened? What's wrong?



It's Paul.



I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.



He's back in jail.



It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.



What's so funny, mom?



Yeah, why are you laughing?



No problem is insurmountable.



Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.



Paul did need to go away.



This is the police.



Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.



- But death wasn't the answer.



Police. Open up.



We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.



- Life in prison will do just fine.



For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.



Hey, get over here.



You're part of this family, too.



I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.



A guy's been stabbed.



Stay with us.



Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.



Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.



Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.



More sh*t for us to deal with.



Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.



They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.



So, things still rocky at home?



Oh, with Rudy?



Yeah.



I'm not calling until he apologizes.



I'm done being second choice.



Good for you, Morgan.



If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.



For you.



It's too late. You blew it.



I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.



I'm too tired to talk.



Well... let's go home, fall into bed.



Why, Rudy?



I mean, f*cking why?



You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.



You wanted to talk to my brother.



I was confused.



Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.



I was confused because I love you.



What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.



What did you say?



I love you.



Don't try to...



f*ck.



What?



I love you, too.



What happened to your lip?



I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.



Well, let's get you home and take care of it.



So, this is doom.



I've been the architect of so much of it.



It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.



He left me this room for a reason.



Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.



There's only one way to find out why.



Close your eyes, Dexter.



I want mama.



No! Not in front of my baby!



Oh, god. Please don't cry.



It's gonna be okay.



Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!



No!



Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.



Dexter. Close your eyes.



I want mama!



I want mama!



Mommy loves you, Dexter.

Previously on "Dexter"...



So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.



Let's face it, Paul.



You've been a problem.



It's time for you to go away.



It's Paul. He...



He violated Florida's three-strikes law.



The cops picked him up totally strung out on heroin.



He's back in jail.



Holy sh*t! They're f*cking fingertips.



He started getting all rough with me until he saw this.



Then what?



Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.



Told me to take my fake hand off.



He takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.



Menthol?



Like cough drops.



I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he...



Son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.



I was confused because I love you.



What did you say?



I love you.



I love you, too.



What happened to your lip?



No, it's -- I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.



I need an ambulance at



1228 Calendar Street.



A guy's been stabbed.



I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.



The same images running through my head over and over.



I was there.



I saw my mother's death.



A buried memory, forgotten all these years.



It climbed inside me that day.



And it's been with me ever since --



My dark passenger.



You should be focusing on me, socio.



Seriously want to get the m*therf*cker that did this to Batista.



I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.



How's he doing? Do we know?



Still in surgery.



Laguerta's there.



God, I hate feeling so helpless.



What, no jokes about providing gross sexual comfort in a time of crisis?



Our friend was stabbed...



And he might die.



Officer Morgan.



What do you think, Dex?



He put up a fight. There was a struggle.



Attaboy, Angel.



Here, this trail --



Steady stream of drops.



He had a few seconds. Tried to move away until -- till he fell.



So much blood.



What's happening to me?



No way.



You're the one I'm supposed to meet.



In the flesh.



You know, I was just talking to someone about you.



That tickles.



Don't stop.



I wouldn't dream of stopping.



You're so different this time --



Gentle.



Are you gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again?



Actually, your...



...imperfection is what saved you the first time.



Saved me from what?



True artistry.



The message of my work is -- not in the product itself, but rather the presentation.



That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.



It's quite unsightly, actually.



Hey, you don't have to be an as*h*le about it.



Hey, hey, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.



I'm sorry.



I didn't mean to offend.



Truthfully...



I'm thankful for you.



You're my escape plan.



Escape from what?



The police.



Because of you, I've had to speed up my... project.



I need something to distract them by.



And I always found a freshly chopped-up body always does the trick.



Wait, wait! No!



Don't struggle.



That never helps.



I'm compressing your carotid artery, and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.



In about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.



Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.



Okay, I guess you went to bed.



Or you fell asleep on the couch watching "Xena" reruns, which I still think makes you a dork.



Either way, call me when you get this, okay?



Miss you.



He's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.



So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.



No. I mean, I can't.



Alright. I understand.



You need to be there for your friend.



I haven't told the kids yet.



Told them about Angel?



No, about Paul...



Being back in prison?



I hate breaking their hearts. They think so much of their dad now.



Right.



You know what?



Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.



Thanks.



They're actually coming out right now. I got to go.



Angel sustained severe internal injuries.



He lost a lot of blood.



But... the surgery was successful.



It looks like our boy's out of the woods.



I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.



But I can't focus.



I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.



I need to know what it means.



Morgan.



What the f*ck is wrong with you?



I have someplace I have to be.



Well, we all got someplace to be.



But you just found out that somebody who was supposed to be your friend is gonna live.



Does that make you feel anything?



Anything at all?



Take your f*cking hand off me.



Just what I always thought.



Right.



♪ Deck the halls with parts of bodies ♪

♪ La-da-da-da dum ♪



sh*t. Just what I need.



Hey.



I know it's late.



I guess you didn't get my message.



I drove by and saw your car.



I can go.



Get your a*s in here.



It's about time you see where I live anyway.



You have no idea how much I needed this.



You feel good.



And cold. You're freezing!



Well, then stay and keep me warm.



This Batista thing has gotten to you, hasn't it?



Angel's daughter was there.



That's got to be rough.



Daughter of a cop --



Just like you.



Yeah.



I remember what that's like --



Kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.



Let's get out of town for the weekend --



Just the two of us.



We need to talk.



I'm sitting right here.



Nope.



The time has got to be right.



Okay.



It'll have to wait...



At least till we catch the as*h*le who did this to Batista.



Let me warn you -- I can be very persistent.



I need to get out of town, and I need you... to come... with me.



What I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.



I'm totally wired from all this sh*t.



Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.



My loving arms.



And...



I got a little thing to help you sleep.



That ain't no little thing.



I meant Valium.



It's one of the perks working at the hospital.



Wine and Valium?



I'll be totally helpless.



You read my mind.



Well, as I live and breathe!



You miss me?



You and the bear claws you're hiding behind your back.



This must be important.



Haven't seen much of you lately.



No rest for the wicked.



How's Gene?



Good days and bad.



He just finished his first round of radiation.



Well, he's a good guy.



Not much of a bridge player, though.



Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and I would take them to the cleaners.



I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.



Well, sure thing.



Got a date?



Not exactly.



It's the crime scene where Harry found me.



I wish I could help, but... everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basement at City Hall.



And... as you can see, I'm up to my you-know-what in year-end reports, so...



It's my lieutenant.



Camilla, is there anything you remember?



What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his home and give you a loving family.



I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.



Who found the body parts?



I did.



They were left under the tree.



I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around...



Till I found the head.



I told him not to touch anything, but he never listens.



God, Patty, you're such a b*tch.



Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary before you found the body?



There were some broken ornaments by the tree.



Who could do something like this so close to Christmas?



The Grinch.



Oh, you're a f*cking riot, Max!



Like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this.



There go our jobs.



Thank you for your cooperation.



Oh, sucks to be an elf.



...Get some visual surveillance.



I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?



Female victim. Cut up into pieces.



The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?



Yep. And after the bloodbath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the press on this one.



James!



Yeah?



I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.



And will somebody turn off this g*dd*mn snow machine?!



Your sister can help you out.



That a whole sexual-tension thing or am I missing something?



103.



It's the same numbers he left at Marina View hotel.



Any leads as to what they mean?



We've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers



-- Nothing.



They need more to go on.



First he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.



Now he leaves me this --



A calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.



It doesn't make sense.



Crime scene's wiped clean.



Another hooker?



Ho, ho, ho -- Another dead ho.



Somebody's been naughty.



Hey, Morgan.



Want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for Christmas?



And he's back!



No, thanks.



Last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.



This doesn't seem right.



Body parts scattered among the presents.



Broken ornaments.



It's not his usual meticulous style.



It seems rushed...



Haphazard.



That would explain why we can't find one of the hands.



What's wrong?



There's something underneath the torso.



Merry Christmas, Miami.



After all this time, why do you think the ice-truck k*ller has struck again?



Any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.







Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?



Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."



Stop the tape.



What are you doing?



Look at her tears. They're rolling up.



Oh, my God.



Bastard's got her upside down.



That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.



Please. No, please, no --



All right, turn it off.



I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.



Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.



With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.



Not anymore.



The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.



We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.



This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.



No, no, no. Do as he says.



The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.



He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.



So you're just gonna sit back and take this?



Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...



I'll be at the hospital.



All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.



Tastes better that way.



Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?



I miss him.



Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.



Where is he?



Well, uh...he's --



He's back in jail, isn't he?



Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.



He loves you guys so much.



I forgot my math book.



I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.



We could write him a letter.



It's all your fault.



You could at least pretend you want to be here.



You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.



Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.



He's been acting weird lately.



Last night he said we need to talk.



Well, that's never good.



Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.



I've only been obsessing about this all day.



Think you could talk to him for me?



Look, it's Rudy.



I sort of called him.



Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.



Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.



Oh, sh*t.



That's work. I have to go.



Here, take mine. Sorry.



What's with your lip?



Deb catch you with a right hook?



She can be pretty protective with the remote.



I had a little... workshop accident this morning.



Doesn't look like it happened this morning.



The cut's already closing up.



Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.



I think I'm working too hard.



Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.



My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.



Your sister's wrong.



So this whole "need to talk" thing?



I'm starting to look at the big picture.



She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?



No, I don't know.



But I do know that Deb's falling for you...



Hard.



You hurt her...



And you'll hurt me.



Something like that.



Angel, se recupera.



Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.



Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.



Y además...



I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.



Hey, you.



You had us so worried.



If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.



I'm gonna get the doctor.



No, no, no. What are you doing?



No, dejalo.



The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.



That's why I got two, right?



It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.



Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.



We don't have any leads.



Did you see anything?



No.



He was behind me.



I just felt the blade go in.



It happened so fast.



Maria...



How long has Nina been here?



She was the first one at the hospital.



She's been with you the whole time.



Yo no sé porque, pero...



My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.



Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.



The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.



I need to know more details.



I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.



You should see this.



That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?



This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.



Angel is stabbed from behind.



You think it's the attacker's blood?



We know Batista fought back.



Well, run the DNA.



If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.



Already sent a sample to the lab.



All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.



Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.



Last gasp of a desperate man.



Things are gonna change around here.



And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"



I can't watch this again.



I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.



Wait -- What was that?



The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.



Watch.



That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.



He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.



But check this out.



Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.



This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.



Most likely it was a custom build.



So we should focus our search on commercial districts.



No.



Residential.



You think he built this in his own place?



He picks up hookers, right?



I worked Vice.



The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.



How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?







None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.



Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?



The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.



And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.



We'll map out grids.



We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.



We catch a break...



We'll catch this son of a b*tch.



Wait! Where the hell are you going?



I need to do some research on a case.



You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.



I've been freaking out!



He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"



He misspelled "come."



Dexter.



This is no time to joke.



This is good, right? A romantic weekend?



What did he say to you?



Oh, wait, no. Don't.



Don't tell me.



Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.



Unless I should know. Should I know?



Okay.



Tell me.



You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?



Who says that unless you're getting dumped?



I don't think that's what this is about.



He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.



You know, I always do this.



I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.



He wants to be part of the family.



What?



Wait.



Like...



Propose?



I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?



Oh, my God.



Oh, my God!



I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.



No details --



Just a blur of images rushing by.



But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.



So do I.



This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.



The Tribune's archives...



10/3?



1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.



This is what he wanted me to find all along.



Close your eyes.



Don't look.



Laura Moser...



My mother.



No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.



If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.



October 3, 1973.



Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.



Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.



First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.



You've been busy.



A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?



It's a long time ago.



What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!



Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!



Camilla...



Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.



I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.



I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.



You did what?



Made a promise to your father.



Why, to protect him?



To protect you.



Harry had a code.



He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.



Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.



You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.



Yeah!



Dex! Cody's run away!



Are you sure?



Yeah, I've looked everywhere.



Well, call the police. I'll be right there.



Okay.



Camilla...



I need to know the truth.



Kid...



Leave this one alone.



I can't sit here like this.



I should be out there doing something.



Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.



The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.



Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?



What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?



It's all my fault.



Honey, what are you talking about?



I should have heard Cody get out of bed.



I'm his big sister.



Hey. Hey, look at me.



It's not your fault, okay?



Okay?



Could you go get Dexter some water?



God.



I should have seen this coming.



Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.



Paul.



Today's Thursday, right?



Yeah.



I think I know where Cody might be.



Hey.



Need a push?



Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?



He'll be here.



Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.



Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?







After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.



He won't even look at me.



I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.



Well, you didn't tell them the truth...



About their father.



I told them Paul was back in jail.



Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.



They should hear that.



You're not a parent. You don't understand.



You do anything to protect your kids.



Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.



You're protecting Paul.



Well, I -- I got to get them home.



Somebody's in a good mood.



The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.



They've been in Matthews'



office for two hours.



You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?



I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.



Tell me that did not just happen.



It's who you know and who you blow.



Probably picking their f*cking tee time.



Maria, watch your back.



He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.



Let him try.



My man Juan, hook it up.



They didn't have "Road and Track" so...



That better be a bag of applesauce.



Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.



You got to be kidding me!



Two double-meats?



A man's got to eat.



You're so cute when you're annoyed.



You know, your mouth makes those little O's.



God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?



Well, not now you don't, no.



Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?



Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?



When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.



No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.



When you come home?



I thought the way things are going with us...



I thought you'd forgiven me.



Well, of course I forgive you.



I forgave you a long time ago.



Okay, so let's fix this.



This could be a second chance for us.



What?



Look, you did what you did.



It was hard.



But it got us to face the truth.



We were miserable... for years.



Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?



Maybe.



What if I do?



Look, you will always be Jorge's father.



I will always care about you.



I'll always be here for you.



But our marriage is over.



Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.



Maria...



Let's you and me have a talk.



Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.



You must be thrilled.



But now, if you don't mind --



Let me get right to the point.



All our mishaps these last few months --



Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...



Even Neil Perry --



Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...



Not mine.



They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.



Well...



I'm glad to hear you say that.



Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.



So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.



Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.



I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.



Please, it's ridiculous.



You really don't want to do this.



Because of your status in the Cuban community?



I'm a f*cking hero to this community!



You think they're just gonna accept it?



Your replacement has already been selected.



Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --



A real up-and-comer.



Pascal, the Haitian-American?



The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.



Turns out she's an actual hero.



You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.



I did warn you, Maria.



I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.



Expect a call from my union rep.



You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --



And my f*cking lawyer, too!



...with all the other detectives.



This isn't f*cking over, Tom!



You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!



Oh, you got to be kidding me.



How are you?



How the hell do I look?



I can barely remember how I got here.



Look, there's something we need to discuss.



If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.



Sit. I'm not finished.



f*ck you.



Astor and Cody are in the other room.



Jesus, you brought them here?



Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.



I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!



Fine.



Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.



You will never see your kids again.



Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.



I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.



If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.







Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.



And I know you love them.



But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.



Now, you cheated on me.



You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.



But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.



But not for me, for them.



I... wouldn't know what to say.



Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.



It's a valuable lesson.



It's one you never got.



So what's it gonna be?



Okay.



Daddy!



Daddy!



Hey!



All right, this won't take long.



There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.



Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.



How are things with you and Rita?



Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.



That's rough, man.



Maybe I'm not the right person for her.



Some people are meant to be alone, right?



Dex, socio, alone sucks.



Hijo de puta!



Sorry.



Teeth marks.



You definitely wounded this guy.



Good.



I hope I broke his f*cking nose...



Or at least gave him a fat lip.



Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?



Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.



Nice guy.



Why?



At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.



He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.



But he's got my full attention now.



Hey, you here tonight?



Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.



Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.



So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?



Tragically, no.



I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.



Good.



Good?



I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?



No, I meant good that you're making progress here.



Yeah. We're getting closer.



Fingers crossed.



At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.



We've defined the area for the residential search.



Good.



So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --



That him?



Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.



Go ahead. Answer it.



Okay.



Hey.



Hey, Supercop.



What's the word?



I'm kind of in a thing right now.



Got it. I'll be quick.



You never answered my text.



Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?



Yeah, about that --



Come on, Deb, it's only two days.



I know, I know. It's just --



We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.



I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.



You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.



Okay, okay but --



How about dinner?



Oh, my God, you are persistent.



Well, you got to eat, right?



So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?



Where the hell did you get a yacht?



I rented it.



I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.



And there is that thing we need to talk about...



Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.



I can work with an hour.



I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.



Right.



Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.



All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.



I'll see you soon.



Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.



He's a loving boyfriend.



He spends his life helping people in need.



He brought me steaks.



Well, that's just rude.



Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?



And a security camera?



How do I get his DNA now?



At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.



But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."



Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?



[f*ck me!]



I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.



Did you do all this?



In fact -- I did.



You like?



I like.



I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.



Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.



I'm sorry.



I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.



I have to turn around and go right back.



Oh, my God. Hold on.



Hold on. Wait!



Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.



I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...



Here it goes.



I know this seems fast...



But I feel --



I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.



And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.



Debra Morgan...



Will you marry me?



I knew it! I f*cking knew it!



Is that your version of a "yes"?



Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --



No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.



Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?



Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.



I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --



Okay, I get it.



You do?



No, not really, but I can work with it.



Good, good.



Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?



Yes, but...



There's a condition.



I know you have to go to work, but...



If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.



One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.



Rudy, I --



I mean it.



You can't leave your sort-of fiancé



on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.



Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.



And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.



I can live with that.



Hey, I need these two tested against each other.



It's kind of a rush.



Excuse me, hi.



Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.



Okay.



It's Deb. Do it.



Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.



I'm in the building.



This yacht's amazing.



I didn't know you went for stuff like this.



Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.



Was that just the phone ringing?



Yeah -- Big brother.



I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.



Good. I want you all to myself.



So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.



You're not drinking?



Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.



What's the matter?



Nothing.



Just bad memories.



That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?



Right.



Wait. How did you know that?



I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.



Hilarious.



Your champagne's gonna get warm.



You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?



How did you not know who I was?



You're a cop.



This isn't funny.



I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?



You're hurting me.



I didn't show you the best part of my loft.



Built it myself.



Stop it!



The refrigerated room.



Oh, God, why are you doing this?!



You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.



The other women I could just pay.



But at the end...



You made it easy.



So desperate to fall in love.



Stop.



Dude, you got to see this.



The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.



One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.



I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.



He's precise.



Not now, Vince.



Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.



I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?



Because our girl...



Our girl was a f*cking amputee.



I looked up her medical records.



She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.



The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.



Let me see that.



That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.



Guess what the lead was about.



The ice-truck k*ller.



Booyah.



You sure?



Positive.



The samples you gave me were a match.



They're from the same person.



Hey, you all right?



Where's my sister?



Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.



She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.



Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.



I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.



Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.



It's Deb. Do it.



Where the f*ck are you?



I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.



Do not see Rudy until you find me.



Call me when you get this.

Previously on "Dexter"...



I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?



Female victim, cut up into pieces.



The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?



This is what he wanted me to find all along.



Dexter...



Laura Moser...



My mother.



Laura Moser and 3 others found chopped up with a chain saw.



Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.



Angel was stabbed from behind.



You think it's the attacker's blood?



We know Batista fought back.



The samples you gave me were a match.



They're from the same person.



So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.



Let's face it, Paul.



You've been a problem.



I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.



I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place.



You really don't want to do this.



Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.



This isn't f*cking over, Tom!



Debra Morgan...



Will you marry me?



Yes, yes, yes.



Where's my sister?



Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.



She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.



You made it easy.



So desperate to fall in love.



Where the f*ck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.



I need to talk to you.



Do not see Rudy until you find me.



I've lived in darkness a long time.



Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.



I don't have much time -- or, to be more accurate, my sister doesn't have much time.



He wants me to find him, but where do I look?



I can't think.



It's too bright.



Let me know if the tape's too tight.



You know, there's no need for you to be uncomfortable.



Why are you doing this?



Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.



Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!



Shh, I'm just checking the supplies, okay?



Things are moving a little faster than I had planned.



This isn't you.



Pretty sure it is.



No!



I know there's more -- I've seen it.



I never wanted to hurt you.



I know. I know.



Does this make it easier for you? Because I can keep going.



Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.



Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!



There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb. I mean, you're not the only one who bought it, okay?



Your name isn't even f*cking Rudy Cooper, is it?



Nope...



But he died for a good cause.



Yeah, so will you.



You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?



Not some invisible hooker -- you kidnapped a cop!



It's all part of the plan.



Oh, Jesus.



It's hard to believe it's almost come to fruition.



I mean, this is a lot of years in the making.



We're only hours away.



He wouldn't have taken Deb unless he left me everything a clever monster would need in order to find them.



♪ Born free, ♪

♪ As free as the wind blows ♪

♪ As free as the grass grows ♪

♪ Born free to follow your heart ♪



Seems I have a new screen saver.



I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded, but "Born free"?



Of course.



Thanks to Rudy, now I know where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.



Born free of all that's human --



That's where I'll find him.



She knows.



She knows.



All f*cking night with that.



She knows.



Listen, Angel, we need your help.



Masuka says you were following up a lead on the ice-truck k*ller when you were att*cked.



A hooker with a prosthetic hand.



John painted her nails different colors, but it didn't go nowhere.



Except she was just cut up by the ice-truck k*ller.



Holy sh*t. Monique was a victim?



Now, we're operating on the theory that he found out you were on his trail.



And if we're right, that means you got stabbed for a reason. It wasn't no carjacking.



How did he know it was me?



No one knew what I was doing except Masuka.



Someone else had to know. Think.



I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.



But that's crazy, right?



No, she's been AWOL since going out last night to meet him.



She was supposed to come back and help me canvass, but she never made it.



That's not like her.



Angel, we got to go.



Go, just go.



There are roughly 5,000 cargo containers in the port of Miami.



Finding the one where my mother was butchered took a bit of magic.



Busted.



Busted.



sh*t.



Just a second!



I told you he was here.



There some reason you're not answering your damn phone?



Ambien.



What happened here, Dexter?



I couldn't find the remote.



Where's your sister?



She didn't come back to work, and she's not at her apartment.



I honestly don't know, sergeant.



Dexter...



We think her boyfriend Rudy's connected to the ice-truck k*ller.



We're working on getting a search warrant right now to search his home.



No. Wow...



Cut the crap.



You know something. What?



James!



I saw him last night, skulking in the lab, ordering secret blood tests.



What kind of tests?



I was looking for a type match on the blood on Batista's collar.



And whose was it?



Rudy's.



m*therf*cker.



Knock it off!



He knew all along!



Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.



Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.



It was just a wild hunch.



Why didn't you tell us?



I couldn't destroy Deb's love life on a hunch.



I had to get the facts.



Here are the facts: if he kills her, it's your fault. Now, what else do you know?



That's it.



He's lying.



Give him a break, James. It's his sister, all right?



Well, if he knows what's good for her, he'll sit his a*s at home and answer the f*cking phone when it rings.



Call if you hear anything.



Hello?



Please don't hang up.



Paul?



The kids don't want to talk to you, all right?



You got to give them more time.



This isn't about them.



It's about how I was arrested.



Yeah, with a needle in your arm -- I know all about it.



Well, I don't.



Listen, I take responsibility for all the sh*t I pulled, but, Rita, I was in the program.



I kicked the hard stuff.



Well, apparently not.



I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.



It's been driving me nuts how I got -- from your house one minute to the motel room the next, completely out of my mind on junk.



Yeah, it's called a blackout, Paul.



It's called a setup.



Well done.



The last thing I remember was standing in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.



Now, he could have smacked me over the head and dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.



You really are a piece of work.



I'm telling you --



Dexter is not who you think he is.



Hello?



This one, I've got to make sure we got about seven copies of these.



I want to make sure it's distributed to everyone, okay?



Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.



Some of you may have met him.



He was dating officer Morgan.



Now, she was last seen 16 hours ago, driving to meet him at the Miami Beach marina.



So we need to canvass the entire area.



Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.



I've already sent a team over to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.



The judge just signed off on the warrant for Cooper's apartment.



Well, let's tear that place apart.



Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.



Your attention, please.



I want to introduce you to our new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.



She agreed to put her vacation on hold, come in early, to provide us with some much-needed leadership at this critical time.



Lieutenant, you're on.



I understand we have a new suspect in the ice-truck k*ller case.



We're on our way over now to search his place.



And you are...



Maria Laguerta.



And we have an officer missing, so we need to move fast.



I thought that sergeant Doakes was running that investigation.



He's out following a lead.



What lead?



He said he'd let me know if it came to anything. Now if you excuse me --



I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.



Who here can get me up to speed on the way over?



I can, I guess.



You're driving.



And feel free to join us when you locate your partner.



Would you like to come with us, captain?



You seem to have everything under control.



Let's go, people.



It's in there somewhere --



My birthplace.



Now what?



No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.



With billions spent on Homeland Security, it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.



So much for the w*r on terror.



Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard isn't hard when every straw is computerized.



Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.



I don't like this place.



Something nameless was born here...



Something that lives in the deepest, darkest hole of the thing called "Dexter."



Get in there!



Somebody else -- Get in there now!



It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.



Nothing will hurt you -- I promise.



Okay, Deb... don't be dead.



sh*t.



Surprise, m*therf*cker.



Are you following me now?



You better have a hell of a reason for being here.



I'm looking for my sister.



In a cargo box?



Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.



You forget you work for the f*cking cops?



We love theories. Spin me a story, as*h*le.



What I do on my time is my business, sergeant.



Yeah, me too, and I'm on my time now.



There's no lieutenant here to save your a*s, so don't f*ck with me, Morgan!



All right, you got me.



I ordered some furniture from Thailand.



I was waiting for it to be delivered.



Lab geek -- My a*s.



Hey, what the hell's going on over here?!



Security, I need to get somebody down here right now.



Miami metro P.D.



Yeah Is this guy under arrest?



That's a good question.



You're connected to this.



I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your a*s.



Let me out of here, m*therf*cker!



Let me out of here!



Let me out! Let me out! Let me out, you piece of sh*t!



Let me out of here, you f*cking piece -- Aah!



f*ck! Let me out!



Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio, and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.



Bye!



His happy place, where he kills more than time --



This is where he'd leave me a clue.



Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.



I like the cold.



You know, hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.



Yeah, and so can hypochondria.



And a home setup like this would take years to put together.



He must have hated leaving it behind.



What are you looking for?



A clue, signature or calling card --



Anything that might give us a sense of where he went.



Well, I don't think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this.



I mean, look at this place.



Hey, you were right about the victim at Santa's cottage.



He rushed his work.



He k*lled that girl to keep us busy so he could escape, but he wouldn't go without leaving us a message.



We just need to find it.



Check this out.



This is where he played with his meat.



Pretty whacked out, huh?



I can think of 101



uses for this table.



Know what I mean?



He has my sister, Vince.



Right.



I mean -- I didn't mean -- I'm sorry.



sh*t.



You're Karen, right?



That's right.



You're in charge of evidence -- this entire room -- evidence.



Take photos of every item in its original position: work-kit, packages...



Show me the inventory list when you're done.



Is he in charge?



Guess he is now.



Rita?



Rita?



Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.



Can I help you?



I guess Paul never mentioned me.



I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.



Right.



So, having your sponsor do your dirty work --



Which step is that?



See, he's -- he's just concerned for the kids.



No, he's concerned for himself. If you'll excuse me...



I thought he was lying, too, until I saw the proof.



What proof?



Well, the X-rays the prison doctor took of Paul's head --



They showed a skull fracture.



Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.



No. You didn't.



See, after you struck him, the hospital took X-rays -- No fracture.



But in prison, a fracture.



If you know Paul, you'd know he'd bash his own head against the wall to get what he wants.



Well, I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.







No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.



No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.



Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.



Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.



So you've been there?



Bob...



You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.



Okay. Got it.



We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.



You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?



Rudy isn't his real name?



You trying to be smart?



Not trying, no.



If you f*cking know his name, you better --



Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.



What did you find in there?



Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.



It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.



Yeah, okay.



You mind if I...



Be my guest.



It's perfect -- Right out in the open.



At least he's consistent.



Was there anything else near this record player?



Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."



Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?



Down on the floor, please.



It's kind of foolish, Deb.



I don't usually work this way.



Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.



Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --



My mother.



Arrested in '69, again in '71.



Same address listed both times.



1235 Mangrove Drive.



They say home is where the heart is.



Maybe this is where I left mine.



Surprise.



What are you doing here?



White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.



I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.



You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.



Yeah, sometime that's not now.



Dexter, what's going on?



It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.



Oh, God. Is it serious?



Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.



She knows. She knows. She knows.



...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.



Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.



If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!







The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."



We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.



She knows. She knows.



So sorry, Mr. Batista.



We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.



Yeah, don't be so sure.



We never take the violent ones.



They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.



I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.



Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?



Yes, of course.



Half of them don't know their own names.



Got to I.D. them somehow.



That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.



I.D. tech.



Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?



I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.



♪ Ring around the rosie ♪

♪ A pocket full of posies ♪

♪ Ashes, ashes ♪

♪ We all fall down! ♪



Dexter! Dexter!



Where are you, you silly little bear?



I'm gonna find you!



Where can you be?



You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!



You silly bear. Where is my baby?



Where is my Dexter? Where are you?



Here!



Oh, my goodness!



Oh my goodness!



You surprised me, you stinky little bear.



Hey, where could your brother be hiding?



Bynie's right there!



Hey, Bynie.



You weren't supposed to tell her.



You remember now?



Bynie.



You always had trouble saying "Brian."



I have a brother.



A real brother --



None of this foster bullshit.



We're blood brothers, through birth and death.



Watching mom die --



It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?



The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.



You were there, too.



Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.



I've never forgotten the day that we were...



Born.



Exactly.



Where's Deb?



I waited for you before we got started.



Debra!



She's not in here.



Deb!



Debra!



This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.



Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.



Deb?



That was the best wipeout.



You didn't even cry.



Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?



Hi.



Hi.



Look out!



I didn't want to do it this way.



Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.



Rudy Cooper?



His real name is Brian Moser.



Angel, what the hell are you doing here?



I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.



He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.



At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.



Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.



Listen up.



We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.



Last known location --



20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.



Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.







His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.



I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.



Waste of time.



Chain of command.



Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.



Lieutenant, that signal died last night.



By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.



Noted.



Let's get busy, people.



Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.



You think the press matters to me?



It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.



Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.



I agree.



I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.



Okay.



Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.



So you're gonna ignore the lead?



You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.



Nothing personal.



I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.



You made that kind of difficult.



Sorry.



You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.



Not for who you are or anything you do.



Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?



Who does it belong to?



Me.



I got it for you, actually.



I'm really more an apartment person.



You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?



You know...



Doctors, therapists, group leaders --



What a family they were.



You were never put up for adoption.



Afraid not.



You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.



First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.



He wanted to make you all better.



But me --



I could see it in his eyes.



All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --



They all did, so they locked me up.



I didn't even know you existed.



Of course you didn't.



Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.



And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.



Me.



Mom always told me to look after you.



Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.



I don't have to imagine.



I know what you've been going through all these years --



The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.



Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.



You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.



Takes the breath away, doesn't it?



I think we're ready for Debra.



I've prepared her just the way you like.



This time, we'll do it together.



Does it have to be Deb?



It's the only way.



But she's my...



Fake sister I know.



Tell me something...



Your victims --



Are they all K*llers?



Yes.



Harry teach you that?



He taught me a code...



To survive.



Like an absurd avenger?



That's not why I k*ll.



You can be yourself around me.



Who am I?



A k*ller...



...without reason or regret.



You're free.



You can be that way, too.



What about the code?



Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.



Harry did.



And he's been dead 10 years.



You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.



You need to embrace who you are now.



I don't know who I am.



Of course you don't.



You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.



We can take this journey together.



I can't.



Not Deb.



Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.



I'm very... fond of her.



You can't be a k*ller and a hero.



It doesn't work that way!



Morgan!



Cover the yard! We're going into the house!



f*ck.



In the garage!



Through that door!



Cover this door! Cover the door!



Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.



Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.



Cover me, man.



Get in.



sh*t.



Chopper 1 to command --



We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.



Any headache, dizziness?



I'm fine. I just want to go home.



I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --



Standard procedure.



You're saying Rudy called you?



Why would he do that?



I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.



He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.



He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.



He's not the only one.



He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.



Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.



I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.



You're gonna what?



Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.



Are you questioning Dexter?



Morgan.



Back the f*ck off my brother!



He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!



Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!



Way to go, Deb.



I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.



Assholes.



Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.



Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.



Relax. Here.



He's still out there.



Yeah.



And he didn't get what he wanted.



No.



Think he'll try it again?



Maybe.



Yeah.



I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.



No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.



There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.



Well, you're not staying at home.



Well, I'll just crash with you.



Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?



Yeah.



Yeah.



Why me, Dex?



Why'd he choose me?



You're just lucky, I guess.



I was so scared.



I was so scared, so scared.



I know.



Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.



Dad would be so proud.



Dexter?



It's me.



Paul, this is harassment.



Just tell me if he's acting weird.



Who?



Dexter --



He hasn't been himself lately, has he?



How could he be, after what he did to me?



All right, that's it. I'm done.



Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.



I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.



Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.



I just want to know that they're safe.



Why are you doing this, Paul?



You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?



All I want is for you to look for a shoe.



A shoe?



Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.



It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.



And why would it be here?



I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.



Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.



Good night, Paul.



Night.



Screw you.



What did I just do?



I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.



That's what it was -- A betrayal.



The most important single fact about me --



I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.



What do I really owe him after that?



Mr. Morgan?



Mr. Morgan?



That's me.



Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.



Still, you should keep an eye on her.



I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.



But she's okay, right?



She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.



Don't worry. The sheets are clean.



We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".



I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...



We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.



Deb?



Good night, sister.



I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.



Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.



Sweet dreams, Bynie.



Hey.



You weren't supposed to wake up.



I guess not.



Sorry.



Police recorded all your knives as evidence.



Took a while to find your dinner flatware.



Sterling.



I keep it for special occasions.



Which you are.



I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.



It's a service I don't usually offer.



What am I -- One of your victims now?



You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?



No, you're not a trophy...



...but you need to be put down.



Why?



Because of your code?



The safety of my sister.



She's not your real sister.



She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.



I tried to help you by k*lling her.



I know that!



You should know this isn't easy for me.



You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.



You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.



You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.



Your life is a lie.



You'll never be what you --



Sorry.



I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.



How did you know he was here?



A neighbor saw the door open.



We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.



Slight upward angle.



Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.



Looks like a clear su1c1de.



He does himself the same way he did the hookers.



Poetic.



Ret*rded.



Look at him



-- He's dead.



The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.



By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.



I don't care why he did it.



I'm just glad he did.



Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.



I got your message.



How's Debra?



She has all her limbs.



Thank God she's alive.



That poor thing must be a mess --



Falling for a serial k*ller.



What are the odds?



What about you?



What about me?



Are you all right?



Oh, yeah.



No.



I've been through a lot lately.



I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.



We could, too.



I'm sorry I've been so --



Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?



I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.



I can be better about that.



Good.



Who knows?



You might even find I can handle the truth.



I wish that was the case.



The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.



Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.



Now he knows.



My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.



Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.



But I'll never know.



I live my life in hiding.



My survival depends on it.



Dearly damaged Debra --



She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.



She's in hiding now, too.



Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.



That's her tragedy.



My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.



And I'm the only one who mourns him.



Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.



Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.



In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.



Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.



All right, Dexter, protecting our children!



This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.



Yeah, they see me.



I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.
Previously on "Dexter"..



Tonight's the night.



And it's going to happen again and again.



Has to happen.



There he is. He's the one.



You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.



You better be a cop.



No... Forensics.



There is no blood near the body at all.



It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.



I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.



How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?



One of these days, you're gonna tell me.



I told you blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.



How the hell was your date with Rita last night?



Great.



She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.



Open your eyes and look at what you did!



Please, you have to understand.



Trust me. I definitely understand.



Hello?



What are you doing now?



I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.



They found another hooker.



Another one?



That's the third one in five months.



Third? You mean there's a...



Serial k*ller, that's right.



Dex, there are people out there who do really bad things.



Of course, you have to learn how to spot them, but I can teach you.







The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.



Why would he do that?



He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.



He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!



This guy is good.



The k*ller is an artist.



You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?



Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.



But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.



I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.



It just seems odd.



Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.



She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.







I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"



And, yes, I want to play.



I really, really do.



I dream.



I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.



I'm the outsider, looking in.



Yeah! Man!



You want to play, man?! Come on!



In the water!



Look at them. They can laugh and play.



It comes so easily for them.



Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...



...a sea monster.



Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...



So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.



Just a second.



The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.



Explaining it could be kind of...



...awkward.



Hey.



Bagels, brother. Let me in.



Could it be more depressing in here?



Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.



O.J.?



With ice.



So, how you doing?



I'm fine.



Yeah, things are fine.



Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.



So, what's up, hotshot?



All right, get this...



Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.



But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.



It's not as if he's shy.



You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?



I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...







Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.



Tell me about it.



Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...



...On my time!



What's with these?



I've got court.



Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?



Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.



For us, this is brother-sister stuff.



Brings out your eyes.



First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.



I like puzzles.



But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.



Please state your name and occupation.



My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.



And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?



Almost twelve years.



You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.



2,103.



Give or take.



No, 2,103.



Then it's safe to say blood is your life.



Safe to say.



Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...



...and Sasquatch.



In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...



...like they're being watched.



And they are.



Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.



But I see so much more than that.



I'll do this, okay?



I see opportunity.



Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.



He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.



Just another night, until...



...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...



From heinous to unspeakable.



The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.



Happy birthday, Alex!



Thank you.



Rip right into it.



What?



Yeah.



Hope it's money.



Yeah, you wish.



Surprise.



Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.



But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.



It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.



Thanks, dad.



All right, enough corniness.



I see their pain.



On some level, I even understand their pain.



I just can't feel their pain.



It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.



But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...



The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.



Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.



♪ ven conmigo... ♪

♪ junto a mi corazón ♪

Detective!



Buena.



Buena?



Did we get an I.D.?



First on scene pulled the wallet.



We're still waiting.



Hello, Dex.



Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.



In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.



And I thought I was creepy.



Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.



The eastbound's only 40 feet.



It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...



...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.



Get me a team on the westbound causeway!



She's good.



Angel, look at this.



I think there's something in his mouth.



Medic!



It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.



You better check out my friend, too.



No telling what this guy might have had.



This is what he had.



Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.



Hooked up with Sean last night.



The cable-guy Sean?



God, no.



He smelled like cheese.



So the mechanic Sean?



Yep.



He came over.



We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.



We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.



Before I knew it, we were...



Stop that.



You don't want to hear this, do you?



No.



But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.



Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?



Why?



So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?



Don't.



You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.



And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?



Because I'm on head of yours.



Come on. It'll be fun.



All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.



Not now.



What crawled up his a*s?



He hates lab rats.



Well, here's a headline...



It's lab rats that make us cops look good.



Okay, listen up.



We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.



His name is Ricky Simmons.



He was a cop.



Let me ask you something.



Yeah.



When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.



I knew Ricky from the department softball team.



He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.



m*therf*cker!



Call it in!



3H-77 to dispatch.



We need E.M.T. and police backup now.



I'll check the house.



Kara, it's me. It's James.



You're okay.



It's me.



It's okay.



This is so f*cked-up, man.



Going after a cop's family...



Who would do such a thing?



That's why we're here.



But it's still f*cked-up.



They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.



All right. Thanks.



He'd been working the gig for 10



months, and everything was good.



But this...



Going after his wife...



Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.



Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.



Is there any word on the wife?



She should be in surgery by now.



¿Qué pasó?



There's an inconsistency somewhere.



And that would be?



I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.



Look.



Whose is it?



Probably hers.



Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.



I got it.



Good work, Angel.



Well, actually, it was Dexter.



Sergeant?



98, 99, 100!



Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!



Stop it!



Can't stop! Must tickle!



Got to hear the magic word!



I have your magic word right here.



Chocolate chip.



Cookies!



Homemade.



Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.



Two each.



But you never let us eat in our bedroom.



Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.



Are you gonna kiss him?



Actually, yes.



Cool.



Gross!



Cookie?



I wuv cookies.



Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.



No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.



Tell me about your day.



I had court... You know, the blood thing.



And then a crime scene and more blood.



I don't know how you do it.



Well, blood is...



...my life.



...my job.



Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.



But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.



That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.



Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.



You think you can get a babysitter some night?



You mean an actual grown-up meal?



I'd love that. Make a date.



I pick you.



And I pick my sister to chaperon.



Sister.



So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?



Okay.



And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!



How'd you find it?



I put the word out with patrol...



You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.



Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.



This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?



The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?



I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.



This is the same truck.



It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.



Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.



Why is it still running?



It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.



Dios mío.



Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.



Clean slices, no blood.



My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.



How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?



No.



I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.



Our guy's old school.



Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.



The heart does all the work.



It's the most effective method, really.



f*cking butcher.



There are 206 bones in the human body.



He could have left any one of them.



But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.



Who made the find?



Officer Morgan.



Harry's daughter?



Must be in the genes, her and her brother.



This truck's a good get.



It's their first solid lead.



I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.



Well, nice work, lieutenant.



I got the Deputy-Mayor.



Congratulate Morgan for me.



Another beautiful Miami day -



Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.



Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?



Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.



You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.



Okay?



Dude, is this blood?



It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.



It's a new shirt.



What is taking so long?



It's a big truck.



They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.



He's thought all this through.



I know I would.



Your famous hunches telling you anything?



Ice cold.



You're a g*dd*mn riot.



This f*cking guy's toying with us.



Deb's right.



This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...



...They are.



Watching ice melt... This is fun.



Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.



I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.



Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.



Vince Masuka only swings one way.



Yeah, from vine to vine.



Enough.



I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.



This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.



Why go to all this trouble?



What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?



Not "us". Me.



My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...



I think he's trying to impress me...



And it's working.



What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?



Sí, claro.



Bueno.



Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".



I'm getting another call.



Yeah, te amo.



Batista.



¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.



She's still in surgery.



The doctors are hopeful.



Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -



It's a typical day in the neighborhood.



You got to hear this.



Ricky, where the f*ck are you?



I'm gonna try for the back door.



f*ck, he saw me!



Please don't hurt me!



Lieutenant!



National database kicked back the DNA match.



Norberto Cervantes.



Let me see that.



Dame. Ahora.



Es tu día de mala suerte.



Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.



El gusto es mío, patrón.



Police! Put your hands up!



Police! Put your hands up!



Get them down!



Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!



Is that necessary?



It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.



Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.



Yes, I-I've had alc...



...problems with alcohol in the past.



I never tried to hide that.



But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.



I- I've been sober for over a year now.



Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.



But...



I reported it stolen hours before the accident.



Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".



Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...



...but so have I.



Ricky, where the f*ck are you?



f*ck, he saw me.



Please don't hurt me!



The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.



Ricky is dead?



That saddens me.



Shut the f*ck up!



Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?



I'm truly disappointed.



Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.



Word out in the world, sergeant...



Simmons's wife was f*cking around.



Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.



A cop m*rder-su1c1de...



It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?



You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!



We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!



Bullshit.



We don't deal in bullshit.



We deal in good police work...



And good science.



You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.



I never played it.



Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.



Her phone call tells us that, right?



And she was running towards the back door... There.



She turns.



The sh**t sees her.



She's shot high on the chest.



It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.



She loses her cellphone.



She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.



She never got this far.



It's not her blood.



Angel, meet our sh**t.



DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.



DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.



Tell me you're sure about this.



100%.



That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.



Let's nail his coffin and ship it.



Hang on, sergeant.



We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.



You're talking about throwing him a deal?



And then, what? He walks?



If he does, we pick him up on other charges.



If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.



Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.



He's un-f*cking-touchable!



Come on, lieutenant.



We already got a win.



It's not about your win.



It's about the big picture.



I've seen this before.



Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.



Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.



Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.



Davey Sanchez was my partner.



Davey Sanchez was my hero.



That was great.



What, dad?



Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.



How do you fix it?



Two ways, I guess...



Honor Davey's memory...



...and catch the bastard who did this to him.



It's not about vengeance.



It's not about retaliation...



...or balancing the books.



It's about something deep inside.



My father had more than his share of pain.



But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.



Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.



I'll have what he's having.



Wise choice.



You celebrating?



Something like that.



Hey, have we met?



I doubt it. I just moved down here.



I needed a new start.



Girlfriend or boyfriend?



Ex-wife.



She said I drank too much.



Hence the "ex" part.



f*ck her.



Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...



Besides marrying me.



We all make mistakes.



Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.



God! Damn it!



I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.



I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.



No, I've had to move around some.



Say no more.



But home is where my a*s is.



I'm getting mine out of town.



Enjoy Miami.



Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.



You got that right.



Thanks, buddy.



Next one's on me.



You sure you're good to drive?



Been a lot worse.



I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.



That would be... tragic.



Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.



He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.



So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".



My father taught me one thing above all others...



To be sure.



And I am.



Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.



If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.



I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.



It's James.



We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.



This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.



Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?



Man, that's got to suck, right?



Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -



That's not his style.



He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.



So, how long have you two been going out?



A couple weeks, I guess.



Deb never mentioned how you met.



Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...



You have your own place?



No, but I wish I did.



Some day, huh?



Dex, enough with the Inquisition.



No, it's all right.



If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.



Is this guy a keeper or what?



Come on. I'll get you another drink.



Are you guys good?



Yep.



Seems like a nice guy.



They could barely keep their hands off each other.



I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".



But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...



I'm totally lost.



Off your a*s, Cervantes.



Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.



Step away.



Exit the cell.



Where are we going?



The call came down.



They want you moved to a more secure block.



You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?



Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?



Get used to it.



That's from Mr. Guerrero.



♪ Are you sleeping?♪



♪ Are you sleeping?♪



♪ Brother John♪



♪ Brother John♪



♪ Morning bells are ringing♪



♪ Morning bells are ringing♪



♪ Ding ding dong♪



♪ Ding ding dong♪



Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...



...tickles.



Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.



What?



The kids.



They sleep through thunderstorms.



I'm sorry.



Tell me... wh...?



I- I can't do this.



It's okay.



That's okay.



I'm okay.



We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".



Tell me about it.



As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.



It's easier said than done.



Yeah.



But it needs to be right...



For both of us.



Or it won't be right for either of us.



I don't want that. Do you?



No.



You know...



I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.



...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.



Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.



Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.



Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?



And that is important because?



A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...



...relieved of her fingertips.



Why the different nail polishes?



What the hell is this guy thinking?



He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".



I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?



Shari Taylor. Another hooker.



At least he's consistent.



Yeah.



k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...



...or feed their kids.



My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.



Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.



I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.



Morgan? The Captain wants you.



Her.



You wanted to see me, sir?



Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.



Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.







Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.



The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.



And I concur. Congratulations.



You're a good cop, like your old man.



Thank you, sir!



Thank you so much.



You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.



I won't let you down, sir.



I hope you know what you're doing.



I promoted you, didn't I?



Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!



Okay?



Okay.



Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?



Están maravillosas.



Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?



Angel, vete a tu casa.



Okay.



Burning the oil?



I clocked out.



Why are you going at this so hard?



When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.



I know that look, Maria.



You got something to say, just say it.



I just got off the phone with the hospital.



Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.



I got to be there.



James, she died.



Was Cervantes right?



Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?



Was it you?



What the f*ck were you thinking?!



What the f*ck business is it of yours?!



My cops, my precinct, my business!



Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...



She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.



If I go by the book, I take you off the case.



f*ck the book.



There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...



Revenge?



Justice.



Take point on Guerrero.



Thanks.



In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.



It's the humane thing to do.



Those animals, they're the lucky ones.



"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".







Gone to rest his weary head.



The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.



God, these are so good.



Not as good as your good news.



My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.



And the best part...



Laguerta had to say the actual words.



I thought her head would explode.



I'm really proud of you.



You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.



I mean that.



You're the best.



And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.



So, Sean was busy?



It turns out there's another woman.



Who?



Me.



Sean the mechanic is married?



Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?



And you and he are...



So over.



I dumped his married a*s.



I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.



Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.



Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?



I was having a bad day.



The Captain and I had a discussion.



Well, maybe you sh...



Wait. W- What kind of bad day?



It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?



The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.



That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?



That's not fair.



Life's not fair, Dexter.



Can't anyone do anything?



Can't you do something?



No, not now.



So what, then?



The world just keeps spinning out of control?



No.



The world can always be set right again.



That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?



Not anymore.



Be back in a sec.



I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.



Nature calls.



All the planning, the making sure...



Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?



Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?



Yep.



I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.



I gave you a job. You take care of it.



What the f*ck you looking at?



Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.



But next year at this time...



It's you.



And you.



Thanks, dad.



All right, enough corniness.



We meet again...



...for the last time.



I didn't do anyth- Anything.



Some people believe that.



The problem is, I don't.



But it's true.



I was-- I was set up.



By whom?



That-- That family.



They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.



So then none of this is your fault?



I swear.



Okay! Okay! Okay! No!



Okay. Okay. Stop.



All right.



Okay, okay.



It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.



It was the booze.



It takes me over.



That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.



Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.







Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.



Really, I'm so sorry.



You've done this too many times to be sorry.



Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.



That's his truth.



My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.



Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.



You'll like it here.



You and your neighbors have so much in common.



The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.



He came back and left nothing behind but a message -



Come find me.



And I will.



There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.
Previously on "Dexter"...



What happened changed something inside you, Dex.



It got into you too early.



I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.



I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.



What can I do to help?



No blood. What a beautiful idea.



Refrigerated truck.



He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.



I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.



In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "hey, want to play?"







Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.



So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.



I just found the f*cking needle.



Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.



I think he's trying to impress me...



...and it's working.



The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.



Thank you, sir.



Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.



Are you gonna kiss him?



Actually, yes.



We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.



His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.



They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.



Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.



Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.



It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.



Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?



James, she died.



Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.



But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.



Ricky was different.



He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.



Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.



It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.



Not because I'm a k*ller--



Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.



I'm sorry, man.



Thanks, man.



It's a f*cking travesty.



You going after Guerrero?



Guerrero ordered these hits.



I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.



I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.



Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.



I'm not right?



You're right.



...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.



Ricky knew no fear.



People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.



She knew he was a cop.



Wait. Did you tell her?



Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.



How you holding up?



I'm managing.



No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.



A whole life reduced to ashes.



For Ricky Simmons, it's over.



But sometimes, you get a second chance.



Florida prisons kick free



25,000 inmates a year.



They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.



I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.



They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.



Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.



To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.



Too many major arteries were severed--



Femoral, brachial, carotid.



Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.



It was a gruesome scene today--



The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.



Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.







We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.



But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.



All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.



Lemonade for my sweaty workers?



What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?



What's parched?



When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.



Can we have a lemonade stand?



I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.



Thank you for doing this, Dexter.



You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.



But they keep dying.



I can't help it. I k*ll things.



That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.



The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.



Bone meal works the best.



Hey, Rita.



Paul doesn't live here anymore.



No sh*t. He's in jail. But...



See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.



Don't get involved.



I never know in these situations.



I don't have money.



You got a car.



You want my car?



Yeah. The keys in it?



You know my dad?



I sure do, little man.



And you want to know something?



You look just like him.



I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?



Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?



Just give me the f*cking car.



Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.



What?



You think you can take me with your little red shovel?



Everything okay in there?



Yeah.



You need toilet paper?



No.



The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.



I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.



No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...



Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.



I just want my past to go away.



Well, it went away in your Rav 4.



Whatever it takes.



I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.



Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.







Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.



Come on, kids.



What did they use, an ax?



It's blunt force.



See the way the head's caved in?



You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?



She's a butter face.



What's a butter face?



You know, compadre--



She's got a hot body, but her face...



How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.



Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?



And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.



Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.



What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.



See, socia? She knows.



I just got my first official Homicide call.



He's back.



Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?



That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.



I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.



Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.



You all right, Dexter?



This is like a dream.



Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.



I never pegged you for a hockey fan.



There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.



So, what do we know?



Same as the others. No blood.



So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.



No bones flayed.



I think our boy's got his confidence back.



He never lost it. He was just getting bored.



What do you think he's trying to tell us?



That hockey's a violent sport.



What else?



He's escalating the thrill.



Posing his victim in the middle of a



20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.



What did I miss?



Relax. You didn't miss anything.



Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.



This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.



Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.



No blood-- no need for me.



Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.



Is there really a suspect?



I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--



I know her.



Sherry?



Yeah, she called herself Cherry.



We worked the same corner when I was undercover.



You were, like, friends?



Yes.



Do you want a hug?



f*ck off.



I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.



Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.



They said you were good.



Don't bust my b*lls.



I've got the press knocking on the door outside.



Somebody who was here last night saw something--



Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.



They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.



Well, then, he's a suspect.



Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.



Did your brother help you out with that logic?



The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.



We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.







Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.



I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.



Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?



Yeah, I mean...



I didn't cry.



Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?



They may have information that could help us.



No, I want you to work with Doakes.



Maria, she has contacts.



You still got your tube top?



And my nipple clamps.



Don't come back without any information.



Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.



A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.



I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.



My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.



We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.



We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.



What you looking for?



Can I see that one?



Eh, good eye.



It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.



Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...



...do his own butchering in the field.



See the way that blade curves like that?



It's like the talon of an eagle.



15 bucks and she's yours.



I'll take it.



Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?



I'll get your change.



Easy, kid.



What the f*ck are you doing, boy?



I didn't see him.



You all right, mister?



Yeah, I'm fine.



Honest mistake. No harm.



Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?



Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.



So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?



What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?



What about the 9mm?



A handgun?



Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.



You need a wide spread to bring them down.



Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?



Afraid so.



Any of them die?



Just one.



How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?



Not so great, Dex.



When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.



You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.







As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.



k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.



You understand?



Yeah.



Changed my mind.



I think we'll take the Ruger.



r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.



We're not gonna hunt pheasants.



It's a big one.



Yeah.



This deer will put meat on our table tonight.



It's still alive.



For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.



Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?



Really?



Put the poor animal out of its misery.



Hi, Rose.



Hi.



Congratulations on your confirmation.



Thank you. Do I know you?



My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.



I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.



That's terrible. Were they members of the church?



No, Rose, they weren't.



I don't understand.



Rose, have you ever seen this man before?



I don't know. Why are you asking me?



Get away from my daughter.



It's okay.



At my church? In front of my family?



Ricky and Kara had a family, too.



You just opened a dangerous door.



No, man, you did...



When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.



What is he talking about, daddy?



Come on, honey. Let's go.



Daddy.



Let's go!



You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?



You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?



Yo, look who's back.



Pero mirela, como está caliente!



Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?



I let them both pull a train, okay?



Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...



I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.



Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--



You're not a cop. You're a whore.



I'm not a f*cking whore.



f*cking who?



What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?



We trusted you, Brandy.



My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.



He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.



Cherry?



sh*t.



This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.



I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.



f*cking woman-hater.



I was on the street before him. f*ck it.



I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.



Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?







Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.



But I was working all night, so...



You know the driver?



No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.



This is good. This is good. This is a lead.



I should go get Laguerta to listen.



Who's Laguerta?



She's my lieutenant. She hates me.



But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.



What?



Never piss off your pimp.



Laguerta's not my pimp.



Is that right?



b*tch tell you what to do?



Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?



Does she steal everything you earn?



Yeah, she definitely does that.



Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.



I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.



What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?



Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.



Seriously? It's a cactus.



You only have to water it three times a year.



Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.



I didn't. I was at the swap meet.



So, any news on our frosty friend?



One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.



Did you check the DMV database?



As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?



The night watchman.



I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.



She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.



Good.



Why good?



It's good for you.



You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.



Thanks.



All right. Good night, sister.



Don't stay up too late.



Okay.



Thanks for stopping by.



Hello?



Hi.



Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.



No, it's fine. Hi.



I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?



Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...



You need me to pick up Cody after school?



No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.



What about Astor's piano?



Jen's got that covered.



Look, it's social services.



There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.



I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...



I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.



Thank you, Dexter.



As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.



Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.







However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.



Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.



The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.



And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.



He pulled a knife at a party in '97.



Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.



Bullshit.



Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch



(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)



a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.



Does he drive a station wagon?



Excuse me?



Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?



The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.



I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.



Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.



Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.



That's all for now.



Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?



Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.



He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.



You sure we can't get you anything?



I'm fine.



Rita's usually home in time for the kids.



I'm just backup.



Her bus must be late.



My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.



Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.



Probably next week.



Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.



She's doing an exemplary job.



I wish all my home visits were this lovely.



So why do you keep coming around, then?



Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.



We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.



It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.



I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.



In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.



Without him...



You're lucky.



Lucky.



I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.



Sorry.



It's okay.



I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?



Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.



Just try and keep him comfortable.



It's about all we can do for him now.



I don't understand.



A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.



He is getting better, sweetie.



A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.



What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?



She's weird.



Listen, you two...



I'm not going to be around much longer.



Dad, don't say that.



You can make it through this if you fight.



When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.



Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.



Do what?



Just remember our lessons.



What lessons? What are you talking about?



I can't make it without you.



Yes, you can.



If you feel like you're slipping...



...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.



f*cking forensics report.



What'd they find?



Tucci's hair and fiber.



Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.



He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?



Any word from the chem lab?



Same as the other murders.



The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.



You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?



You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.



Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.



Watch carefully. Right there-- see?



Right before he repositioned the torso.



He turned his head.



Like someone's giving him directions.



Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.



The k*ller's framing Tucci.



It looks that way.



Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.



She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.



And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.



Can I borrow this tape?



Bingo.



I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.



Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.



You ready?



I don't know if I want to do this, man.



What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.



I do.



Come on. It's in the marsh up here.



Wait. Are you a p*ssy?



No.



Okay.



Where is this place, man?



It's right up here.



Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?



Don't be a b*tch.



Here we are.



I don't see it.



It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?



You have to get closer.



I still don't see it.



Really?



Maybe I was wrong.



There's no gator here, is there?



I don't know, Lucas. Is there?



Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.



sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.



What am I doing out here?



Oh, f*ck! f*ck!



f*ck!



All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.



Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.



Code of Harry never covered this.



At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.



Don't let her.



Okay, my brave little soldier.



Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.



No!



Wait!



What is it, honey?



He doesn't want the shot.



Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.



I want pain.



He wants pain.



I'll have to tell the doctor.



He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.



You can tell.



About the nurse? Yeah. She's...



...like me.



How could you tell?



She gives too much... morphine.



It's something else. It's making me worse.



She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.



Not just me. Others, too.



Stop her.



What do you mean, stop her?



It's time.



Before she hurts anyone else.



See the look on his face, like he's scared?



Like he has a g*n pointed at him?



I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.



There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.



Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.



There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.



What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?



I came straight to you, Captain.



You went around the back of your commanding officer?



Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...



You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.



Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.



But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.



You got it?



Yes, sir.



Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.



Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?



Who, Morgan?



I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.



Is that what you think I'm doing?



You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.



Thanks for the vote of confidence.



It's a reality check, and you need it.



And I got it.



Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.



No...



No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.



People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.



But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.



A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.



According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.



The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.



These terrible att*cks have to stop.



And we have to stop them.



With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.



f*cking joke.



Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?



Hey, man, sounds good.



Pick you up at 8:00.



Elevator's around the corner and to your left.



Enjoy your stay with us.



Hello?



Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.



Are you coming to pick up Astor?



Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?



I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.



She's the last kid left here at school.



I don't have a car. Is she okay?



Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.



Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.



Do it again!



Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.



Now, let's see about that splinter.



That's a deep one.



This might sting a bit.



But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.



Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?



She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.



She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.



The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.



Hi, guys.



You're right, Astor.



There's no such thing as the boogeyman.



But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.



Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?



Thanks for picking her up.



If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.



Oh, sorry.



Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.



We're not picking up anybody, bro.



Well, what we doing in the Gables?



I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.



What the hell is this?



It's a disguise.



One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.



Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.



I am sh*t-faced.



How do I look?



Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--



This ain't the way, man.



Why the hell not? The guy's scum.



Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.



Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.



I showed my face to Guerrero.



They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!



That's part of the plan.



What plan?



You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.



Now you're just f*cked, buddy.



Open the door!



sh*t.



f*ck.



Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.



Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!



You're mine now.



What do you want?



Silence.



You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.



What guy?



He r*ped you...



The guy you k*lled when you were 15?



Why didn't you tell anybody?



Would you?



He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.



I understand now.



Why didn't I see it before?



Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.



He was taking out the garbage.



Just like I do.



Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.



It's in my backpack.



Wait-- Is that all?



You want more?



That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?



Yeah. He did.



Well, the boy the other day didn't.



Remember that. It could save your life one day.



Mr. Tinker?



Mr. Tinker, where are you?



Mr. Tinker?



Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?



The nurse was my first playmate.



I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.



Things were a little messy in the beginning.



Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.



But I was trained well.



Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.



I've just been looking through your photo album.



Hope you don't mind.



Are all your victims in here?



I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.



Scream and lose a tongue.



I helped them...



All of them.



I took their pain away.



I understand.



Now it's time to take away your pain.



It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.



But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.



With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.



Harry taught me that death isn't the end.



It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.



He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...



...but we must maintain appearances to survive.



But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.



The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.



It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.



Sweet ride! Is it yours?



It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.



I borrowed it from impound right before auction.



Dexter...



Can we get in?



You better.



All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.



Thank you.



Score one for the little wooden boy.

Previously on "Dexter"...



No blood. What a gorgeous idea.



Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold environment... to slow the flow of blood.



I suppose I should be upset, but I'm not.



In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"



Kara, it's me. It's James.



You just opened a dangerous door.



No, man. You did... when you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.



Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?



Was it you?



What the f*ck were you thinking?



Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam. You in?



Hey, man. Sounds good.



I thought you said you wanted to go get sh*t-faced.



I am sh*t-faced.



I showed my face to Guerrero, to his whole church.



They're gonna think I'm behind this sh*t.



You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.



Now you're just f*cked, buddy.



He's escalating the thrill, posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show us what he's capable of doing.



What did I miss?



Fingertips.



f*ckin' as*h*le, that's my girl.



This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.



Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.



Bullshit.



Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.



He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.



I find people around me are always making some kind of connection, like friendship or romance, but human bonds always lead to messy complications... commitment, sharing, driving people to the airport.



Besides, if I let someone get that close,



So, time to put on my mask.



I need your expertise.



I live to serve.



Excuse us, fellas.



Interesting hand job.



That's funny.



It is?



So, how long you think it's been there?



This feels familiar.



Okay. So, how long has it been there?



Blood stopped pooling, still wet... couple hours at the most.



What time was it found?



A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.



No prints. Wiped clean. Real creep show, huh?



Any sign of the rest of the body?



Just Mr. Hand. Do you think this is our guy's work?



The ice-truck k*ller?



It's hard to say. There's blood. That's different.



Plus, it's a male victim-- haven't seen that before.



The cut appears to be almost delicate.



You see between the first and second row of carpals...



Very surgical.



Check out what else he left behind.



A little postcard to remember him by.



How far is Rand Beach from here?



This is Rand Beach.



It was renamed Petrie Beach a few years ago.



Okay, everybody.



Everybody say "stinky feet".



Stinky feet!



Wait. Nobody move. Dexter, were you smiling?



No.



Okay, we'll do another one.



This time, everybody smiles. You, too, Dex.



Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.



Shut your damn face, Deb.



Hey, language, please.



What? She always talks like that.



Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.



What's your problem?



I hate the beach.



It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.



Too bad. You're part of a family.



And being part of a family means smiling for photos.



Why should I pretend I'm happy?



Because it'll make your mom happy, and because it's how you fit in.



Remember we talked about that?



Yeah.



This is how you do it.



When somebody takes your picture, you smile.



It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.



You just do it to fit in. Okay?



Okay.



All right.



Come here, handsome.



Okay. Everybody ready? One more time.



Stinky feet!



Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.



Straight to the station after, yeah. Thanks, lieutenant.







Dexter Morgan, this is your life.



It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.



When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.



...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.



Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...







Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.



I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.



Kelly, I'll get back to you.



What's wrong?



Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.



It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.



What?



Wait a minute.



No. No, no, no. No way.



No way! I mean, this--



This has to be a mistake!



The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.



f*ck!



Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.



Don't!



Just... just don't.



You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.



We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.



All right.



You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.



If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.



Tom!



I'm the last person she wants to see.



I called her son a k*ller!



And now's your chance to make it right.



So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?



I'm taking point.



You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.



Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?



Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?



Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.



I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.



Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.



Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.



Morgan, calm down.



Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.



You see all these people over here?



Yeah.



What are they?



Potential witnesses.



And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?



We-- we interview them. Got it.



Where is he...



The rest of him?



We're-- we're still looking.



The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.



Are you sure it's Tony? Because...



Yes.



I'm afraid so.



Mrs. Tucci...



I said some very harsh things about your son.



Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?



For coming to tell me in person.



For God's sake, please.



There's nothing more important than this.



Can you find my son's body?



If it's the last thing I do.



I made a grave...



Bring him home, please.



I just want to bury my son.



I do love Halloween.



What's inside of a pumpkin?



See for yourself.



You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.



I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.



There he is again, mom.



My god. It's every night now.



That dog? Where's it coming from?



Next door-- My neighbor's.



Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.



It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.



Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.



I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.



Do you want me to talk to her?



No, you don't have to do that.



I insist.



Hello. I don't think we've met.



Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.



Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.



That's precisely why I'm here.



We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.



I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.



Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.



You could, uh, take him inside.



Walter's an outside dog.



You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.



He doesn't like being inside.



Did he tell you that?



We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.



The kids are upset.



Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.



You know what works for me? Earplugs.



I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.



I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.



People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.



Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.



Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.



Some people might call me a fraud.



OK. Let's see if it will fit.



You stabbed me in the back!



I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.



They're so excited.



Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.



Who wouldn't love that?



What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?



No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.



Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.



Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.



Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.



No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "



I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.



Another photo from my family album.



He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.



He's forcing me to see this.







Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.



I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.



Sergeant?



Friends of yours?



Don't worry about it. Worry about this.



The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.



The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.



And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.



Why he's making a switch now?



He's trying to send a message...



One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.



Okay, so what's the message?



I'm not sure.



Well, who's he sending it to?



I can't tell you that, either.



What f*cking good are you?



No f*cking good at all, apparently.



You okay?



He's mocking me.



Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.



Who?



Relax, bro.



Sorry.



I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?



He knows.



He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.



He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.



Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.



Over there. Oh, yeah.



Guys, give it back!



Come on, Simon.



All right. Enough. Get out of here.



What the hell is going on?



We're just having fun.



It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.



You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.



You can't be a bully, Dexter.



First of all it's wrong.



Secondly, people remember bullies.



People like me-- cops.



A bully is a felony waiting to happen.



So...



Blend in.



Go on.



Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.



Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.



You want me to head out to the crime scene?



No.



Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...



Stores, hotels, ATMs.



I want you to check every frame.



You are sh1tting me.



If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.



We have techs who can do this.



Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.



I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.



And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.



It's on its way from the new crime scene.



Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?



Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?



That's not good, James. You should alert the police...







Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.



You think this is a joke.



I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.



You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.



You're right.



I should have waited until the divorce came through.



Bullshit.



What? She didn't tell you?



She filed the papers, jackass.



You don't believe me, ask the Captain.



He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.



Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.



It was his job to protect his wife.



Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.



You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.



Let's go, guys. Time for school.



Guys? Come on.



You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?



Shut up!



Shut up! Just--



I need to talk to you about your dog.



I talked to your boyfriend.



My kids are exhausted.



All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.



So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...



I'm sorry. Is this funny?



No, no, no It's... it's sad.



But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.



I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.



There's nothing you can do.



The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.



But you're funny.



Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.



He wants me to see who he is and what he does.



Everything about him is brazen, authentic.



What does that make me?



Crap.



You okay, man?



No.



Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.



You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.



I'll be all right.



Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.



What is that, a butterfly?



No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.



I'm...



I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.



Congratulations. How many years?



10 years she's been my lucky charm now.



Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.



No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?



Well, it does kind of look like a bug.



This can't be right.



What's up?



You see that? You see it?



I don't know. What do I see?



The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.



Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.



But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.



But... we found them a day apart.



I know.



Dios santo.



L. T., you got to listen to him.



It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.



What are you talking about?



The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.



Tucci's alive?



Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.



Tell them, Dexter.



If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...



We get another body part first thing tomorrow.



But he's alive.



Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.



Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.



Mrs. Tucci?



Maria Laguerta.



I have some amazing news for you.



We believe your son is alive.



No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.



No, thank you.



Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.



We've got a live body now, people.



We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.



That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?



Don't forget the photos. They're new.



Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.



Why do we think he's taking photos?



He wants to be remembered.



You use photos to record memories.



I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...



...pieces he gave me.



He wants me to play the game his way.



Okay, what else could it be?



Change.



You got something to say, speak up.



The beach changed names.



The office park used to be a soccer field.



He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.



Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.



South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.



Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?



They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.



Thank you, officer Morgan.



The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.



Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".



Lieutenant.



Anything?



Well, I am so glad you could make it.



Well, I just came by to show my support.



It's been a long time since I've been to church.



Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.



I would like to introduce you to someone very special.



This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.







Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.



You brought us all here together by giving us hope.



May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.



This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.



Find him.



I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.



And you wanted to apologize why?



You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?



Yeah, you did f*ck that up.



Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.



I need to tell her that I'm sorry.



I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.



Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?



Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".



So, where we at?



I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.



That's everybody we have out in the field--



Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?



What's next is you should go home.



You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.



I like it here with you.



You're the only person people hate more than me.



Come on. Let's both get out of here.



Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.



Officer Morgan.



Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.



Son of a b*tch.



f*ck this.



What?



Want a piece of me?



f*cking as*h*le!



I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.



I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.



It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--



$1 million.



You don't have $1 million.



I'll steal it from evidence.



I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.



I want to be part of the hunt.



I'm almost off duty.



Sorry, sister.



$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.



Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.



My favorite spot. Of course.



Come on. I want to play.



Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?



I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.



But it wasn't condos back then.



This has to be the right place.



So what am I missing?



Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.



Hello.



Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.



You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.



Do you need the address?



No, I know exactly where it is.



Are you okay?



Are you kidding? That was awesome.



You've got some hay in your hair.



Where?



Right there!



Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.



Let me take a picture of you and the kids.



You'll miss these moments when they're older.



Thanks.



It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.



Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.



Ready?



Smile!



What do we have?



Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.



You think Tucci's still alive?



If he is, he won't be for long.



Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.



I am on break. I'm on my own time.



So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.



So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.



Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.



Speaking of b*tch...



Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?



I don't remember.



Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.



Excuse us.



She's right, you know, about the traffic.



It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.



At least he's looking after his patient.



Hey, check this out.



Is this appropriate?



It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.



Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?



No. f*ck!



What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.



Like tic-tac-toe?



No, like "hugs and kisses".



Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.



Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.



g*dd*mn it.



Where's mom?



She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.



But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.



I heard you two were up a lot last night.



It was that damn dog.



Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.



I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.



How do you know?



My mystic powers told me.



Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".



All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.



When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.



Walter! Walter!



You're right. He's gone.



Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!



All right. Here he is.



Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?



My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.



Thank you.



They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.



It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.



I knew this would be a perfect fit.



You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.



Harry was the only one who saw me...



...really saw me...



So he taught me to hide.



That's what's kept me safe.



But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.



If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.



Maybe I am a fraud.



Hi.



Hey.



Where's Astor and Cody?



They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.



Can I come in?



Yeah, sure. Sorry.



I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.



Maybe I can cheer you up.



Trick or treat.



You look great.



Who are you?



Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".



You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.



What happened to Snow White?



Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.



You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.



You took care of your "errand"?



Yes.



The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.



You are a superhero.



It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.



You upset your neighbor.



f*ck her.



Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?



Considerably worse.



Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?



There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.



Maybe I can help.



No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.



Oh, I don't know.



I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.



There's all sorts of things I can do.



What-- what are you doing?



Whatever I want.



I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...



The easy, quiet moments--



This...



...might be better.



Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.



Where's your brother?



I'm not his keeper.



What do you think of this?



It's an anniversary present for Nina.



See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.



It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.



You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.



And I'm not gonna take it back.



It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.



Really?



I would.



How... How do I look? Like the tie?



Angel.



Happy anniversary, baby.



You know you can't just walk in here anymore.



I just thought...



...our anniversary...



Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.



It doesn't matter what night it is.



I told you I need time.



It's been three months, baby.



How much time do you need?



Don't turn this around on me, Angel...



...Not after what you did.



I need as much time as I need.



Angel...



As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?



Lo siento, princesa.



Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.



Thank you.



That was...



...unexpected.



Yeah. For me, too.



I have no problem with... unexpected.



No, you... certainly don't.



I have to get back to the kids.



What are these?



I've been reorganizing my photos a little.



Look how cute you are.



And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.



I was adopted.



I know.



But you're both good men. I can tell.



Very poetic.



Poetic? It's a water fountain.



Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.



His shadow's on the wall right next to you.



It's like he's always with you.



I'd frame this one.



All this time the answer was right here.



Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.



He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.



Rita... you're a genius.



All those years of smiling for the camera...



It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.



Pictures of Harry.



So this is it.



It's cool.



Cool.



Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.



He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.



This place put food on our table.



In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.



I know.



Excuse me, miss! Miss?



Would you mind?



Oh, come on, dad.



Hey, you all right?



It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.



I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.



We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.



Yeah, we are.



Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.



Don't be a baby--



Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?



My friend left this.



He's showing me where to go.



Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?



What do I want?



The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.



Well, James...



Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?



f*ck!



I didn't tell you you could get up.



Please, please.



Now you get up.



You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.



You're a wild dog, Sergeant.



The only thing to do with a wild dog...



Police! Hands in the air!



Thought you could use backup.



You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.



Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.



We own your a*s now.



So this was the plan all along...



To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?



Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.



We're done now, Doakes. We're even.



I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.



Get this piece of sh*t out of here.



Please.



Just do it.



k*ll me.



I'm ready.



Just don't cut me anymore.



Please don't cut me anymore.



Gift-wrapped and begging for death.



Tools at the ready.



Just k*ll me. It's okay.



He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.



I can't k*ll this man.



Harry wouldn't want it.



And neither would I.



Are you Morgan?



Message came through dispatch for you.



Who left this?



Who left it?!



Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.



I'm sorry. I'm so excited.



Try a hug once in a while.



I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.



You saved a man's life tonight.



I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.



But you followed it up.



Right place at the right time, Sir.



Where we at?



Morgan's tip was good.



They're taking Tucci over to county.



Alive?



Alive.



So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.



Really? Is that what you suppose?



I got your page, Lieutenant.



Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.



You're taking point here.



You got it.



I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.



I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.



Entiende?



Si.



Use Morgan here.



How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?



Oh, you were right. She loved it.



You nailed that one.



Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.



Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.



Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...







And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.



And what about me?



Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.



But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.



That's not me, either.



My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.



I'm not the monster he wants me to be.



So I'm neither man nor beast.



I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.



I'm Dexter.
Previously on "Dexter"...



Think this is our guy's work?



The ice-truck k*ller?



Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.



It's the guard-- Tucci.



I think he's alive.



Tucci's alive?



The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.



He's sending me a message.



He wants me to go there.



Please.



He was left here so I would k*ll him.



Just k*ll me.



I can't k*ll this man.



Taking Tucci over to County alive.



I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.



You saved a man's life tonight.



The thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.



There's all sorts of things I can do.



What-- what are you doing?



Whatever I want.



My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.



I'm not the monster he wants me to be. I'm Dexter.



I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone, maybe post-apocalypse or plague, Whatever-- No one left to act normal for, no need to hide who I really am.



It would be



...freeing.



Stop grinning like a f*cking psycho and get back to work.



Sorry, sergeant.



I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before I tear the bed apart.



I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.



My shadow companion chose this place well.



This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.



All these people pawing over it seems...



He was here for days, playing with sharp objects.



I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless, amazingly so.



The only blood I found belongs to the security guard.



Has he said anything yet?



Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.



Lieutenant, up here!



There's got to be something here. Find it.



The guy's not a ghost. Tony Tucci is evidence of that.



Hey, Dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet?



It's like sh**ting a Jackson Pollock.



Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.



Ready?



Okay.



What was that?



Did you see that?



What?



Damn rats.



We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their sh*t in the dust.



We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.



Lovely. Can we get the lights, guys?



You ever heard of rat-bite fever?



Masuka, what'd I say about the f*cking rats?



You haven't found anything, won't find anything.



This is a bust, right?



In so many words.



Which means I'm just jerking off till Tucci wakes up.



So take a break. You've been working this thing 24-7.



Or are you still avoiding a personal life?



Oh, f*ck you.



And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.



Thanks, guys.



It doesn't have to be either/or.



Maybe not for you.



If I found someone, so can you, right?



Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.



Tell me about it.



Yelina? Are you okay?



I'm sorry. I'm fine.



Ernesto hasn't arrived?



I'm sure he'll be here soon.



No.



The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.



Coyote?



You mean the man you paid to bring him here?



He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.



But that was a week ago, and no one in Cárdenas has heard from Ernesto.



Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?



...This was his number, but it's not working anymore.



I was supposed to leave him money in a park.



Listen, my boyfriend works for the police. I'm sure he--



No, no, no. We can't go to the police.



He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba.



No, it's okay. It's okay. Dexter will know what to do.



I feel just terrible for her.



And they were supposed to be married after he got here.



I do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues.



I can talk to him.



That's really kind of you, Dex.



I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your fiancée is dead or alive?



Uh, no.



Every night after work Yelina goes across the street, to the beach.



I've seen her there, just... staring out at the water, willing him to walk out of it.



Have you ever longed for anything like that?



She wants something from me. Ever since the blow job, she assumes we've taken it to the next level.



She doesn't know yet-- I don't have a next level.



Well, when I was a kid, I would have k*lled for an Atari.



You know?



Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man...



It always comes to this once sex is introduced.



Small talk no longer cuts it.



Eventually she'll call me a science project and slam the door in my face.



But when do you think he'll wake up?



Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a k*ller out there that's into whores and security guards, but I'll bet nurses are next.



Yo, check you, all "MPD Blue".



Shanda, what are you doing here?



You have another lead on the ice-truck k*ller?



Man, I got bigger worries than that sick sh*t.



Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?



I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what you're after.



Oh, hell, no.



But my landlord's another f*cking story--



Trying to kick me out of my home.



Shanda.



He got no cause, except he's a born-again hypocrite m*therf*cker.



Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?



No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.



Morgan. Found this in evidence.



Masuka was gonna grease it through.



A cigarette butt?



Jesus, we could pull DNA off of that, or even a print.



Except it would be your print.



You were smoking on a crime scene.



Not on the crime scene-- like on the way-far end of the park.



The whole area's a crime scene. You should know that by now.







Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.



Who the f*ck is that?



Give it a rest, Shanda.



Morgan, go do something useful.



Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.



And do not talk to him without me!



Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.



No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.



So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?



A few.



The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.



Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".



Except the damn coyote...



He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.



If they can't pay...



They disappear.



Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.



Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.



You have any suspects?



Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.



If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.







Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.



You'd be surprised.



Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.



They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.



No neighbors, no foot traffic



-- It's promising.



A good place for human trafficking... or worse.



Excuse me. Private yard.



I'm just praying you have a '69



Stingray headlight somewhere in here.



Dave Cutler.



Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.



Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.



I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.



I'll be happy to look around myself.



No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.



You run this whole place alone?



Yeah, it keeps my costs down.



Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.



You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.



That's my vette guy. Yeah.



Must be nice being your own boss--



Get out in the water whenever you want.



I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.



Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.



I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?



I got a rowboat with a hole in it.



A lo major los pescados te encuentran.



I don't speak Spanish, sir.



Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.



American, pal, just like you.



Just like me.



He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.



I'll wait.



Hey.



Mr. Tucci.



Tony.



I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.



I swear.



I don't understand America's obsession with cars.



I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.



It's someone's American dream



-- my nightmare.



This must be where Castillo locks them up.



But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.



So where are they?



Dexter Morgan.



Gerard here.



There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.



Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.



She's a maid. She's not my--



Is it all right if I bring her down?



The sooner, the better.



Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.



Tonight at the Salsa Room.



You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.



Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.



Blow it off. I'm buying.



Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?



I can't deal with



800 anonymous tips.



I'm working on it.



Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?



Sexy.



Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.



I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.



I wonder if it'd work on Rita.



Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.



Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.



Yeah.



Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?



Should I?



Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.



She senses I'm not a shoulder.



Bad sign-- She's catching on.



I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.



If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.



That must be what love looks like.



The inability to feel has its advantages...



...sometimes.



Hey, Dexter.



Hey, Mindy.



Do you need any help?



No.



So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?



Why would I want to do that?



She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.



That's not what she said.



Well, you have to learn their signals.



Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.



I just like being alone.



But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.



Even though I'm not.



Because you're not.



We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.



Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.







Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.



Well, I'm alive.



I didn't see that happening, but here I am.



Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...



I don't know.



I just might have to fight you for this one.



Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.



Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.



Excuse me.



I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.



Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.



Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.



Gosh... I'll get it.



Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?



You are a dog, aren't you?



So the ladies tell me.



Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?



White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--



Not fat, not thin, just... average.



I don't know.



And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...



Did you hear anything?



Did he have an accent or anything?



He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.



And that's all you heard?



Except the rats.



Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.



Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?



You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.



Yeah?



You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.



Really?



We could even blindfold you again.



...I'm kind of tired right now.



It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.



Alone.



No pretending. No hiding.



No time to relax. I'm too close.



Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.



But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?



That I have to prove.



Jorge's not-so-humble abode.



Yeesh-- new money.



Normal people dream of this--



A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.



Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.



They're so happy.



She has no clue who she's with.



Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.







Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?



It was just me and Caesar, my dog.



He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.



What did this guy do?



Why? Does he look familiar?



Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.



What was that?



How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?



Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.



You said you got a look at him.



He had a cap.



Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?



Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.



You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.



We're done here.



Give me a minute.



Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.



Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.



Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.



We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.



Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.



You could try being a little more optimistic.



I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.



You might get more out of people.



How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?



Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.



Okay.



This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.



And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?



What the f*ck were you thinking?



Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.



I... I was trying a new approach.



Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.



Come on. How can you not dance to this?



It's a gift.



We just need some more patrón, compadre.



Another round!



No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.



Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?



Yes!



Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.



Your wife-- She's probably worrying.



I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.



She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.



La pasión?



Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.



What about... communication, trust?



La pasión.



Wait.



What if she wants something more?



Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.



No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?



Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.



It's easier, and she'll be distracted.



Come on. Let's dance, Angel.



So...



What do you want to do now?



Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.



Get her punch. Open the door for her.



And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--



Dad, I've kissed a girl before.



You have?



Yeah.



And?



I don't know, it was okay.



Dexter, women are different from men.



We've had this talk, dad.



I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.



When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.



And they know when you're not.



They can sense it because you're very exposed.



Yeah, you're naked.



I mean emotionally.



Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.



I can fake it.



Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.



This is a tough one.



Is this it?



Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.



Wake up.



Your wife's gonna love me.



The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.



You scared the hell out of me.



Sorry, Nina.



I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.



What are you doing here?



It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.



He got a raise?



Yeah.



Well, as you can see, he...



...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.



He doesn't live here anymore.



We're separated.



So... good night.



Oh, okay.



Good night.



La pasión.



Angel.



Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.



I guess I had one too many, huh?



And then about 10 more.



How did I end up here?



You don't remember?



So you live here, huh?



I live here.



You're kind of neat, aren't you?



Bad habit instilled by mom.



We better get going.



Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.



Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.



I have to stop by home anyway.



My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.



No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.



Where's your bathroom?



Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.



I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--



Rat hair.



I probably picked up a parasite just--



Don't test me, Masuka.



You see all that shredding?



Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.



They took evidence away from the crime scene?



Exactly.



So we check their nest.



Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.



We could talk to Tucci again.



He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.



Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.







I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--



All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.



But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.



So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.



And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.



How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?



You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?



You can't hide for long, Jorge.



Hello?



Dexter, it's me.



Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.



The morgue.



Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?



I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?



Still a little shaky.



I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.



Maybe we could rent a movie.



Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--



Something light.



Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.



I hate this.



I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.



I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.



La pasion.



Dexter?



I'm sorry. I...



I was just...



You were so generous with me.



I was gonna... return the favor.



No, that's very sweet, but...



Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.



That you, Dex?



Yeah. Sorry I'm late.



It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.



No, I pretended to.



That's good, Dexter.



Dad?



Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?



I hope so, son.



I really do.



Alone, I'd be better off.



Relationships are too confusing.



But this I can figure out.



This I do well.



Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.



There's always proof, and I'll find it.



Happy and in love...



The perfect couple.



I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.



Focus.



If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.



He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.



If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.



Yep--



This I do well.



Think about his shoes.



Did he walk with a limp?



Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?



Try to remember, Tony, for me.



I would if I could, hon.



You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.



No, no, I don't mind.



It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.



It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.



We should try the blindfold.



What?



I.. don't want to do that.



I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.



I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.



So, Morgan, you're up.



He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.



So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?



Rats. Always those damn rats.



Try to focus on him, Tony.



What did you hear? What did you smell?



Menthol.



Menthol?



Yeah, like cough drops.



He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--



He unwrapped them.



I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.



And he sucked on them.



I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...



The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.



Nothing in this nest.



Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.



f*ck this.



Masuka.



We got another one over here.



Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.



These rat b*stards were repeat customers.



Who had garlic for lunch?



I'm gonna punch you in the neck.



Actually...



I think you're gonna French me.



...2934. I like being right.



I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.



The boy scouts and I have that in common.



Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.



What are we looking at?



They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.



Lozenge wrapper?



Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.



My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.



How human of him.



We have a partial.



Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!



Proud of you, sis.



Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?



Crime scene.



Excuse me.



What's, uh-- What's going on?



We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.



A partial f*cking print.



You run it through AFIS yet?



It doesn't even matter if we get a match.



He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.



We get it photoed before we scan it.



And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.



Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.



And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.



You never know. We might get lucky again.



It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.



Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.



Come on! Entrar, entrar.



God bless America.



Hon?



Where are you?



Honey?



Honey, you in here?



Iderrito a mi familia!



Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!



f*cking animals.



Incredible.



They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.



You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...



...perfect couple.



You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.



You're a really good team.



It's clever, too.



No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.



So, which one of you thought this up?



They get freedom. We free them.



They thank us, for God's sake!



For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.



We can pay you. We have money.



That's what it's all about, right?



I love you. I love you so much.



I love you so much.



I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.



No more bullshit. Do you understand?



How long have you been married?



12 years.



How do you love each other?



You're like me, and you make it work. How?



We want the same life.



We both-- We want the same thing.



You share the same dream.



Yes, exactly, yes.



Yes, that's it.



That's...



...helpful. Thank you.



No.



I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.



Valerie got short shrift.



But all in all, it was a very good night.



I like this place.



A lot of memories are buried down there.



Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.



But sometimes you just have to take a risk.



After all...



...isn't that what relationships are all about?



Do you have a dream...



...for your life...



Your future, I guess?



Of course. Do you?



It might sound weird.



I want to someday be content and just feel...



...comfortable, like everyone else.



I want...



A normal life.



Yeah, a normal life.



That's all I want. Just that.



No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?



No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.



Now... I'll take boring.



Average.



Ordinary.



That's weird, huh?



Yeah.

Previously on "Dexter"...



No blood -- What a beautiful idea.



Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.



It is my new friend.



When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --



My life, my secrets.



Paul doesn't live here anymore.



No sh*t. He's in jail. But...



See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.



The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.



Poor b*stards --



Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.



They can't pay...



They disappear.



Jorge Castillo --



The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.



Excuse me. Private yard.



Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.



American, pal, just like you.



Just like me.



Coño. Come on.



Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.



They're even better-matched than I thought.



f*cking animals.



God bless America.



Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.



My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.



But sometimes you just have to take a risk.



Life is so fleeting, so fragile.



Every breath the potential to be our last.



You ready?



Can I have my cereal now?



We all grieve in our own way.



Sure.



I prefer the 6-year-old approach.



Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.



Well, not quite.



Hey, what about this one?



I want angel cake.



So how'd it go?



Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.



Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.



Dead stuff...



I know.



Well, go have a seat.



Your treat for coming over early is on its way.



I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.



Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.



That one! That's the one I want.



Coconut it is.



I hate coconut.



You've never had coconut.



It's dispatch.



I might have to settle for toast to go.



Morgan.



Sure, what's the location?



I'll be right there.



The crime scene.



My crime scene.



I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.



A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --



What did I leave behind?



Impossible.



Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.



It had to be him. He's watching me.



Dex?



Good. I.D. the victim.



You find anything else?



That ain't enough?



Any eyewitnesses?



Just do your job. Worry about the blood.



You gonna answer that?



This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.



You heard the man.



He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.



He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.



Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.



I've got the press sniffing outside already.



No, it's not his M.O.



We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.



And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.



Then, try and track him down.



Sir, we found something.



You got anything?



No bruising.



Nothing under her nails.



She didn't put up a fight.



If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.



Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.



Prints?



She's clean.



This trailer -- That's another matter.



I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.



Yo, Dex, I think I found something.



Zoom in on this, will you?



I'm kind of low on batteries here.



Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.



Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.



You're not Chinese.



I'm not?



Look, right here.



Does that look like a needle mark to you?



It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.



Yeah... I guess.



I'll let the coroner bag her.



I'm hungry.



This ain't no auto garage.



Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.



You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?



Yeah, just not indoors.



Well, the army taught me a lot of things.



I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.



Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.



I'm not really getting that.



It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.



Everybody's sh*t stinks.



Here we go.



We were partners a long time.



From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.



You like the husband for this?



It's always the husband.



What have you got?



It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.



Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.



Sergeant Doakes!



We heard movement in the trunk.



I got it. I got it.



Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.



Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.



Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...



You all right, kid? Come on, man.



No!



Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.



Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.



The noose is tightening.



This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?



Hey, Deb.



I usually like kids.



Who's the boy?



All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.



Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.



Did he... you know? see anything?



I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.



Social services is on the way.



You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.



Morgan, bring some water!



I love her.



Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.



My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.



Deb, we've been through this.



But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...



...or I can walk with you guys.



I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.



The pheasants will know you're there.



But Dexter was my age when --



Deb, that's enough.



The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?



Yes.



Good girl.



I want to see that backflip when we come home.



All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.



She does kind of have a point, dad.



What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.



Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...







...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.



Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.



I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?



Balloons aren't much of a list.



It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.



How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?



It's your party. You can have whatever you want.



Hello?



Hey, babe, it's me.



Go wait in the car.



What's wrong with mom?



She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.



Hi.



I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.



She's a Cuban refugee.



She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.



Why scratch the number in the floor?



Next of kin, in case something happened to her.



Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.



He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.



That explains the garage.



And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.



Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.



Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.



Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.



Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?







¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?



Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.



When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.



No teníamos comida ni agua.



Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.



They went without food and water.



Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.



How'd she get free?



¿Cómo escapó?



Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.



Somebody opened the door to the garage.



Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.



She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.



Concha? Ah, got you.



f*ck me. The wife was in on it.



Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.



¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?



¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.



She never saw a boy.



No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.



You're hovering.



Keep reading.



What am I looking for ?



Wait for it.



This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.



Etorphine hydrochloride?



An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.



It causes total paralysis.



That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.



That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.



Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.



The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.



I put a request in for the list.



I should have it for Doakes in the morning.



Nice.



Yeah, baby.



I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.



Ticktock.



Hey, you.



Thank god you're there.



I really need to talk with someone.



Everything okay?



Paul called after you left.



Paul? Who's Paul?



My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --



Overcrowding. Can you believe it?



Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.



What did you tell him?



I'd have to think about it.



But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.



Can you -- Can you come over tonight?



I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.



I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.



No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.



Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.



Thanks. Bye.



Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.



We'll search the house.



Where's Laguerta?



Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.



Sketch?



He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.



Valerie Castillo?



It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.



Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.



Yeah, you say that now.



Found his passport.



God...



I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.



Well, keep searching.



Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.



Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.



Maybe.



This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?



What thing?



Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.



I was just looking out for my team.



I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.



I would if she'd asked.



I didn't ask.



Fine.



Next time, just get your a*s shot.



It's possible our guy left town.



If he even did it.



What if we have a copycat k*ller?



That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?



Just hear me out.



What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?



She wasn't a hooker.



But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.



Except she wasn't in pieces.



But she had cuts on her neck.



I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.



What do you suggest, Morgan?



Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.



Fine. Whatever.



That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?



We got one more stop to make.



Nothing lasts forever.



Just ask a Ford Pinto.



Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.



There's really not much of a retirement plan.



But it can't end like this. It's too soon.



I'm not ready.



He saw me.



What's this?



You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.



Did you forget your laundry?



She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.



And here's the plan. We go in.



We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?



I'm, what, your exit strategy?



Look, you can stay out here if you want.



That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...



...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.



sh*t!



My sisters are here, too.



f*cking family reunion!



So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.



I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.



I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.



Morgan!



Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.



We're used to it.



When James graces his family with this presence.



Some of us don't work at a bank.



Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".



Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.



That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?



If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.



Yeah, Tony's doing okay.



The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.



I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.



The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.



That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.



Ma!



Well, it's the damn truth.



Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.



Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.



Yeah. We're sure.



You know...



I would love some cheesecake bit.



You can wait in the car. That's your call.



He'll wait.



I'll do the dishes.



I'll help you.



Ooh, I'm sorry.



I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.



I'll be breaking their hearts, too.



He is their father.



They have a right to know he's been released, right?



Yeah, sure.



Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.



I know him.



Everything's been going so good at work...



With you.



I don't know what to do.



He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?



Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...



He said if I...



...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.



Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.



Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...



Astor...



She was the one who called the police the last time.



She was protecting me.



You're not that woman anymore.



You're stronger than that now.



If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.



Dad's coming home?



Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?



I shouldn't even be here.



Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.



Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.



It's kind of hard not to take that personally.



Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.



Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?



Any last words?



Figures.



I don't have bad dreams.



When I sleep, all of me sleeps.



Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.



I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.



What's happening to me?



If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.



Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.



And there I am.



Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.



Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.



What are you doing in here?



My computer went down.



I was just checking some e-mail.



Can you take a look at this for me?



Copycat k*ller?



I worked all night on that profile.



I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.



I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."



Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.



Let me guess --



Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.



It's a little textbook, don't you think?



But it totally fits this case.



You're trying to make it fit.



My advice?



Keep this to yourself.



Really?



Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.



No.



I'm on to something here. I feel it.



Like one of your hunches.



Way to have my back.



Where's your sister?



Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?



How did you get into my cabinet?



You hide the key in the pantry...



...on the top shelf.



You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.



But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.







And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.



I'm disappointed in you, Debra.



Grab your things.



Thanks a lot.



Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.



Those days I don't miss.



The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.



Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.



Come on, sweetheart.



Let's take the seatbelt off.



There you go. Come on.



Come on, sweetheart.



You want to go inside to see the nice lady?



Come on, sweetie. Let's go.



Thanks for bringing him by.



Hola, Oscar.



¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?



Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.



You have kids?



No.



I was like him once --



A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.



Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.



Any luck with the family?



No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.



He just uses the first name.



Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.



I hope so.



I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.



Thank you.



Bye, sweetheart.



Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.



That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.



Be thorough. Check everyone.



Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?



Still processing, sir.



If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.



Morgan.



Any ideas?



Don't do it, Deb.



The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.



We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.







If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.



I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.



I'll be in my lab.



Hello, Dex.



Oscar...



¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?



Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.



Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.



I'll be right back.



No!



Está bien, me quedo aquí.



I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.



He just needed a little reminder of home.



I was barely his age when I came over with my family.



I threw up the whole damn way.



¿Quieres más?



¿Cinco?



Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.



Save me some.



No, dice que no.



Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.



No es 5, es 10.



¿10?



Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.



30.



50?



50.



Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?



Yes.



So, what do you think?



Everything okay?



You want to talk out it?



Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.



Honey, that's not true.



I spoke with their moms last week.



It's all Cody's fault.



He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.



Did not!



You told everyone!



I have to know.



Dexter...



Thank god.



My arm's asleep.



How long have you two been like this?



Half an hour.



I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.



At that age, when they're out, they're out.



You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.



Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.



Oh, thanks.



What are you doing here?



I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.



Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.



We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.



It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.



If you, um... here.



You want help or not?



I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.



Luckily, you're in good hands.



I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.



Boys?



Yeah. What I really needed was tits.



I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.



Morgan.



Try not to blink, okay?



Okay, okay. I'll do it.



I'll do it.



Let me ask you something.



Your brother's adopted, right?



Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.



How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?



It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.







Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?



Dex? God, no.



I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.



Here, I think I see it.



There's the bastard.



Thanks.



Let me ask you a question.



Why do you have it in for me?



You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.



Fair enough.



I hear you have an interesting theory on --



Honey, what is it?



Sweetie.



I'm sorry. It was an accident.



It's all right. These things happen.



Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.



Mommy?



Is it okay if I didn't have my party?



It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --



Me.



Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.



If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.



I have to let go.



Alex Timmons -- sn*per.



Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?



Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.



Have you ever watched someone burned alive?



Cindy Landon -- Black widow.



I'll f*ck you if you let me go.



Such fond memories of them all.



They all accepted their fate in their own way.



Now it's time for me to do the same.



Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.



He's not angry. That's not what this is about.



He's testing me.



I was wrong the whole time.



My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.



If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.



Just got off the phone with the FBI.



Now for the hard part.



I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.



I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.



11 new hits.



How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.



I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.



We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.



You never give up, do you?



Thank your mom for dinner the other night.



Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.



You held your own.



Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.



In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --



A Morgan tradition.



I miss that kind of stuff, you know?



I found something.



The wife's blood? You're sure?



This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.



We check all the clothing items that come in.



Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.



It doesn't prove anything.



Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.



Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.



They're long, deep.



Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.



No sh*t.



The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.



He was probably afraid of getting caught.



Most K*llers are.



Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.



He would savor his first k*ll.



He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.



This is all too... passive.



Have you completely ruled out the husband?



Why are you doing this?



The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.



Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.



You really think it's the husband?



He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.



Plus, he's still missing.



Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?



I'll have them send the cadets out again.



Hey, I'm sorry.



I know how hard you worked on that profile.



No, Dex, I really don't think you do.



How long are you grounded for?



Two months.



Deb, I had to tell him.



No, Dex, you didn't.



You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.



Dad was worried about you, and so was I.



Well, now you can spend more time together.



I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.



No, it's not.



Deb, you're my sister.



No, I am not. And he is my father!



There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!



Dexter, I am... so sorry.



I really... really didn't mean it like that.



Here.



I thought you might want that.



You're a better shot than me anyway.



Hello?



Paul, hey, it's me.



Look, we need to talk.



Sure thing.



I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.



Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...



...don't come to the party.



I just want...



She is my daughter, too, Rita.



I have every right to be there.



You know what? I'm sorry.



I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.



Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.







So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.



The second call is to your parole officer.



I need the sergeant.



Morgan.



I'll be right there.



Está listo.



Ya lo tiré.



Oscarsito.



Itío Roberto!



The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.



That's great. He should be with family.



Can I take him home?



We're good.



Thank you.



Thank you for finding him, huh?



He's a very special boy.



I know.



Cuídate?



L.T., you need to see this.



You okay?



These contacts.



Dios mío.



Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.



The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.



No more m*rder w*apon.



There's blood.



Want to bet it's the wife's?



It's always the husband. You were right all along.



Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.



Deb will forgive me... eventually.



That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.



Nothing like me.



Laguerta thought you should see this.



What you got ?



That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.



Son of a b*tch.



Dex.



Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.



Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...



I hope.



Too f*cking weird.



Jesus Christ saved this kid?



On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?



When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?



Nice turnout.



I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.



Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?



After presents.



Ready?



Make a wish, baby.



Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.



It already came true. Dad's not here.



I want the middle piece.



Okay.



I was wrong about birthdays.



Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --



The hope of living to see another one.



The thing about Deb forgiving me --



I better give her a few more days.



I barely escaped getting caught this time.



I realize now my days are numbered.



So I better make the most of them.



All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.



But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.



Like Harry said in my dream...



...the storm's on its way.
Previously on "Dexter"...



No blood -- What a beautiful idea.



Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.



It is my new friend.



When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --



My life, my secrets.



Paul doesn't live here anymore.



No sh*t. He's in jail. But...



See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.



The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.



Poor b*stards --



Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.



They can't pay...



They disappear.



Jorge Castillo --



The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.



Excuse me. Private yard.



Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.



American, pal, just like you.



Just like me.



Coño. Come on.



Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.



They're even better-matched than I thought.



f*cking animals.



God bless America.



Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.



My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.



But sometimes you just have to take a risk.



Life is so fleeting, so fragile.



Every breath the potential to be our last.



You ready?



Can I have my cereal now?



We all grieve in our own way.



Sure.



I prefer the 6-year-old approach.



Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.



Well, not quite.



Hey, what about this one?



I want angel cake.



So how'd it go?



Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.



Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.



Dead stuff...



I know.



Well, go have a seat.



Your treat for coming over early is on its way.



I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.



Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.



That one! That's the one I want.



Coconut it is.



I hate coconut.



You've never had coconut.



It's dispatch.



I might have to settle for toast to go.



Morgan.



Sure, what's the location?



I'll be right there.



The crime scene.



My crime scene.



I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.



A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --



What did I leave behind?



Impossible.



Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.



It had to be him. He's watching me.



Dex?



Good. I.D. the victim.



You find anything else?



That ain't enough?



Any eyewitnesses?



Just do your job. Worry about the blood.



You gonna answer that?



This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.



You heard the man.



He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.



He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.



Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.



I've got the press sniffing outside already.



No, it's not his M.O.



We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.



And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.



Then, try and track him down.



Sir, we found something.



You got anything?



No bruising.



Nothing under her nails.



She didn't put up a fight.



If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.



Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.



Prints?



She's clean.



This trailer -- That's another matter.



I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.



Yo, Dex, I think I found something.



Zoom in on this, will you?



I'm kind of low on batteries here.



Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.



Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.



You're not Chinese.



I'm not?



Look, right here.



Does that look like a needle mark to you?



It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.



Yeah... I guess.



I'll let the coroner bag her.



I'm hungry.



This ain't no auto garage.



Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.



You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?



Yeah, just not indoors.



Well, the army taught me a lot of things.



I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.



Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.



I'm not really getting that.



It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.



Everybody's sh*t stinks.



Here we go.



We were partners a long time.



From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.



You like the husband for this?



It's always the husband.



What have you got?



It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.



Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.



Sergeant Doakes!



We heard movement in the trunk.



I got it. I got it.



Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.



Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.



Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...



You all right, kid? Come on, man.



No!



Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.



Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.



The noose is tightening.



This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?



Hey, Deb.



I usually like kids.



Who's the boy?



All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.



Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.



Did he... you know? see anything?



I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.



Social services is on the way.



You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.



Morgan, bring some water!



I love her.



Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.



My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.



Deb, we've been through this.



But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...



...or I can walk with you guys.



I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.



The pheasants will know you're there.



But Dexter was my age when --



Deb, that's enough.



The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?



Yes.



Good girl.



I want to see that backflip when we come home.



All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.



She does kind of have a point, dad.



What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.



Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...







...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.



Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.



I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?



Balloons aren't much of a list.



It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.



How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?



It's your party. You can have whatever you want.



Hello?



Hey, babe, it's me.



Go wait in the car.



What's wrong with mom?



She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.



Hi.



I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.



She's a Cuban refugee.



She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.



Why scratch the number in the floor?



Next of kin, in case something happened to her.



Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.



He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.



That explains the garage.



And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.



Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.



Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.



Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.



Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?







¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?



Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.



When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.



No teníamos comida ni agua.



Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.



They went without food and water.



Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.



How'd she get free?



¿Cómo escapó?



Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.



Somebody opened the door to the garage.



Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.



She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.



Concha? Ah, got you.



f*ck me. The wife was in on it.



Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.



¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?



¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.



She never saw a boy.



No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.



You're hovering.



Keep reading.



What am I looking for ?



Wait for it.



This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.



Etorphine hydrochloride?



An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.



It causes total paralysis.



That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.



That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.



Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.



The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.



I put a request in for the list.



I should have it for Doakes in the morning.



Nice.



Yeah, baby.



I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.



Ticktock.



Hey, you.



Thank god you're there.



I really need to talk with someone.



Everything okay?



Paul called after you left.



Paul? Who's Paul?



My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --



Overcrowding. Can you believe it?



Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.



What did you tell him?



I'd have to think about it.



But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.



Can you -- Can you come over tonight?



I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.



I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.



No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.



Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.



Thanks. Bye.



Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.



We'll search the house.



Where's Laguerta?



Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.



Sketch?



He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.



Valerie Castillo?



It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.



Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.



Yeah, you say that now.



Found his passport.



God...



I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.



Well, keep searching.



Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.



Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.



Maybe.



This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?



What thing?



Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.



I was just looking out for my team.



I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.



I would if she'd asked.



I didn't ask.



Fine.



Next time, just get your a*s shot.



It's possible our guy left town.



If he even did it.



What if we have a copycat k*ller?



That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?



Just hear me out.



What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?



She wasn't a hooker.



But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.



Except she wasn't in pieces.



But she had cuts on her neck.



I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.



What do you suggest, Morgan?



Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.



Fine. Whatever.



That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?



We got one more stop to make.



Nothing lasts forever.



Just ask a Ford Pinto.



Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.



There's really not much of a retirement plan.



But it can't end like this. It's too soon.



I'm not ready.



He saw me.



What's this?



You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.



Did you forget your laundry?



She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.



And here's the plan. We go in.



We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?



I'm, what, your exit strategy?



Look, you can stay out here if you want.



That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...



...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.



sh*t!



My sisters are here, too.



f*cking family reunion!



So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.



I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.



I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.



Morgan!



Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.



We're used to it.



When James graces his family with this presence.



Some of us don't work at a bank.



Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".



Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.



That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?



If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.



Yeah, Tony's doing okay.



The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.



I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.



The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.



That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.



Ma!



Well, it's the damn truth.



Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.



Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.



Yeah. We're sure.



You know...



I would love some cheesecake bit.



You can wait in the car. That's your call.



He'll wait.



I'll do the dishes.



I'll help you.



Ooh, I'm sorry.



I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.



I'll be breaking their hearts, too.



He is their father.



They have a right to know he's been released, right?



Yeah, sure.



Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.



I know him.



Everything's been going so good at work...



With you.



I don't know what to do.



He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?



Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...



He said if I...



...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.



Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.



Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...



Astor...



She was the one who called the police the last time.



She was protecting me.



You're not that woman anymore.



You're stronger than that now.



If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.



Dad's coming home?



Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?



I shouldn't even be here.



Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.



Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.



It's kind of hard not to take that personally.



Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.



Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?



Any last words?



Figures.



I don't have bad dreams.



When I sleep, all of me sleeps.



Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.



I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.



What's happening to me?



If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.



Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.



And there I am.



Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.



Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.



What are you doing in here?



My computer went down.



I was just checking some e-mail.



Can you take a look at this for me?



Copycat k*ller?



I worked all night on that profile.



I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.



I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."



Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.



Let me guess --



Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.



It's a little textbook, don't you think?



But it totally fits this case.



You're trying to make it fit.



My advice?



Keep this to yourself.



Really?



Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.



No.



I'm on to something here. I feel it.



Like one of your hunches.



Way to have my back.



Where's your sister?



Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?



How did you get into my cabinet?



You hide the key in the pantry...



...on the top shelf.



You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.



But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.







And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.



I'm disappointed in you, Debra.



Grab your things.



Thanks a lot.



Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.



Those days I don't miss.



The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.



Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.



Come on, sweetheart.



Let's take the seatbelt off.



There you go. Come on.



Come on, sweetheart.



You want to go inside to see the nice lady?



Come on, sweetie. Let's go.



Thanks for bringing him by.



Hola, Oscar.



¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?



Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.



You have kids?



No.



I was like him once --



A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.



Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.



Any luck with the family?



No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.



He just uses the first name.



Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.



I hope so.



I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.



Thank you.



Bye, sweetheart.



Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.



That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.



Be thorough. Check everyone.



Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?



Still processing, sir.



If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.



Morgan.



Any ideas?



Don't do it, Deb.



The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.



We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.







If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.



I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.



I'll be in my lab.



Hello, Dex.



Oscar...



¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?



Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.



Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.



I'll be right back.



No!



Está bien, me quedo aquí.



I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.



He just needed a little reminder of home.



I was barely his age when I came over with my family.



I threw up the whole damn way.



¿Quieres más?



¿Cinco?



Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.



Save me some.



No, dice que no.



Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.



No es 5, es 10.



¿10?



Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.



30.



50?



50.



Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?



Yes.



So, what do you think?



Everything okay?



You want to talk out it?



Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.



Honey, that's not true.



I spoke with their moms last week.



It's all Cody's fault.



He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.



Did not!



You told everyone!



I have to know.



Dexter...



Thank god.



My arm's asleep.



How long have you two been like this?



Half an hour.



I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.



At that age, when they're out, they're out.



You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.



Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.



Oh, thanks.



What are you doing here?



I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.



Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.



We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.



It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.



If you, um... here.



You want help or not?



I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.



Luckily, you're in good hands.



I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.



Boys?



Yeah. What I really needed was tits.



I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.



Morgan.



Try not to blink, okay?



Okay, okay. I'll do it.



I'll do it.



Let me ask you something.



Your brother's adopted, right?



Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.



How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?



It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.







Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?



Dex? God, no.



I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.



Here, I think I see it.



There's the bastard.



Thanks.



Let me ask you a question.



Why do you have it in for me?



You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.



Fair enough.



I hear you have an interesting theory on --



Honey, what is it?



Sweetie.



I'm sorry. It was an accident.



It's all right. These things happen.



Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.



Mommy?



Is it okay if I didn't have my party?



It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --



Me.



Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.



If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.



I have to let go.



Alex Timmons -- sn*per.



Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?



Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.



Have you ever watched someone burned alive?



Cindy Landon -- Black widow.



I'll f*ck you if you let me go.



Such fond memories of them all.



They all accepted their fate in their own way.



Now it's time for me to do the same.



Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.



He's not angry. That's not what this is about.



He's testing me.



I was wrong the whole time.



My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.



If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.



Just got off the phone with the FBI.



Now for the hard part.



I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.



I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.



11 new hits.



How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.



I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.



We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.



You never give up, do you?



Thank your mom for dinner the other night.



Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.



You held your own.



Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.



In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --



A Morgan tradition.



I miss that kind of stuff, you know?



I found something.



The wife's blood? You're sure?



This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.



We check all the clothing items that come in.



Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.



It doesn't prove anything.



Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.



Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.



They're long, deep.



Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.



No sh*t.



The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.



He was probably afraid of getting caught.



Most K*llers are.



Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.



He would savor his first k*ll.



He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.



This is all too... passive.



Have you completely ruled out the husband?



Why are you doing this?



The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.



Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.



You really think it's the husband?



He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.



Plus, he's still missing.



Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?



I'll have them send the cadets out again.



Hey, I'm sorry.



I know how hard you worked on that profile.



No, Dex, I really don't think you do.



How long are you grounded for?



Two months.



Deb, I had to tell him.



No, Dex, you didn't.



You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.



Dad was worried about you, and so was I.



Well, now you can spend more time together.



I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.



No, it's not.



Deb, you're my sister.



No, I am not. And he is my father!



There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!



Dexter, I am... so sorry.



I really... really didn't mean it like that.



Here.



I thought you might want that.



You're a better shot than me anyway.



Hello?



Paul, hey, it's me.



Look, we need to talk.



Sure thing.



I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.



Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...



...don't come to the party.



I just want...



She is my daughter, too, Rita.



I have every right to be there.



You know what? I'm sorry.



I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.



Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.







So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.



The second call is to your parole officer.



I need the sergeant.



Morgan.



I'll be right there.



Está listo.



Ya lo tiré.



Oscarsito.



Itío Roberto!



The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.



That's great. He should be with family.



Can I take him home?



We're good.



Thank you.



Thank you for finding him, huh?



He's a very special boy.



I know.



Cuídate?



L.T., you need to see this.



You okay?



These contacts.



Dios mío.



Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.



The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.



No more m*rder w*apon.



There's blood.



Want to bet it's the wife's?



It's always the husband. You were right all along.



Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.



Deb will forgive me... eventually.



That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.



Nothing like me.



Laguerta thought you should see this.



What you got ?



That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.



Son of a b*tch.



Dex.



Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.



Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...



I hope.



Too f*cking weird.



Jesus Christ saved this kid?



On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?



When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?



Nice turnout.



I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.



Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?



After presents.



Ready?



Make a wish, baby.



Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.



It already came true. Dad's not here.



I want the middle piece.



Okay.



I was wrong about birthdays.



Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --



The hope of living to see another one.



The thing about Deb forgiving me --



I better give her a few more days.



I barely escaped getting caught this time.



I realize now my days are numbered.



So I better make the most of them.



All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.



But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.



Like Harry said in my dream...



...the storm's on its way.
Previously on "Dexter"...



Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.



Hey, Angel, I got him!



They really found the ice-truck k*ller?



I saw him, Dex. I chased him.



The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.



Son of a b*tch.



I have so many questions for him.



What was his message to me?



Now I need to know him.



Hi.



The f*ck are you?



Paul Bennett. Father on parole.



Dexter Morgan.



I can't think of anything clever to say.



Divorce papers -- Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.



You think you can really make me back down?



Are you f*cking my wife?



I just wish he'd go away.



I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?



All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.



But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.



I realize now my days are numbered.



So I'd better make the most of them.



Your instincts were dead-on.



They're always dead-on when it comes to K*llers. Why is that?



I'm watchin' you.



What are we looking at here?



I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.



You?



No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?



Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you?



I like seafood.



Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.



Not as hard as her.



Damn power outages.



I don't know, Angel.



Most firearm suicides are committed by men.



Women tend to slash their wrists, take pills, something more ladylike.



Not in Miami.



We closed a couple of su1c1de cases just like this last year, remember?



Look at this mess.



That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?



House husband. And aspiring artist.



Promising.



So, she supported him?



It looks like that.



She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.



Those other suicides we closed -- those were high-powered women too, right?



I don't know. I think so.



Note to self.



I don't care what it looks like. Somebody k*lled her.



We're checking out all the possibilities, Mr. Gayle.



Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem?



You know, job stress, the usual, but she was working through it in therapy.



She have any other problems that you're aware of? Threats?







Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.



Criminals stage suicides all the time.



You don't even know the guys she put away.



We'll check into it.



We need to collect your clothes for evidence --



Standard procedure.



Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.



There's a hot body in here.



I so want to maul you right now.



I so want you too.



Call me when you're done, okay?



Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.



Morgan, what took you so long?



Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?



I don't f*ck and tell.



Since when?



Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.



Don't.



No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.



See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.



It's always the husband, right?



Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --



Younger guy, unemployed.



Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.



I'm on it.



Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?



I'm a team player.



You are?



f*ck you!



Hey, Dex, come on in.



Where's Rita?



She's stuck in traffic.



Power's out in half the city.



Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.



Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.







I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...



What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?



Sorry. Sorry I'm late.



Thanks for holding down the fort.



Do you mind if I get going?



I got kids of my own at home to look after.



No, no, no. It's okay.



Dexter and I are here now.



Great. Thank you.



Bye, kids.



Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.



They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.



Dad already made us some.



With extra marshmallows!



Tag -- You're it!



I'd love some hot chocolate.



Take two. Looks like he's got extra.



Come here, buddy.



Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?



I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.



Dexter doesn't mind.



Only a song, no story --



It's way past your bedtime.



All right, bedbugs.



Let's leave these two alone.



It's not like they need a chaperone.



Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --



All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.



They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.



Why the sudden interest in suicides?



Morbid curiosity.



What can I do for you?



So many things...



I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.



Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.



Me too.



Maria.



The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.



I'm working on it.



When'd you talk to the D.A.?



We had dinner last night.



Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --



Hell of a good time.



Hiro de puta.



I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.



I wouldn't be too upset.



Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.



You still believe we got the wrong guy?



Perry's the pretender to the throne.



The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.



It's just a matter of time.



Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.



You really think that might happen?



If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?



Definitely.



Thanks, Dexter.



What if Laguerta's right?



What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?



No.



He's got unfinished business with me.



Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.



I need a distraction.



Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.



Talk to me, ladies.



What do you have in common?



Same sorority?



Pilates instructor?



Dr. Emmett Meridian.



The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --



Dr. Emmett Meridian.



He must be terrible at his job.



So far, he comes up squeaky clean --



No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.



And I thought I was a master at damage control.



Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.



Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.



Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.



Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?



The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.



So...



What brought you here?



A friend of mine died.



She k*lled herself.



I need to understand why.



How come?



She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.



To some people, death makes perfect sense.



Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.



What really brought you here?



I just told you I came --



To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.



I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.



You're absolutely right.



How could you tell?



I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.



And what are my real intentions?



As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.



Excuse me a second.



Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.



This guy's good.



So why do his patients keep dying?



Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.



Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.



I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.



So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.



So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?



No.



Girlfriend?



Yes.



Sex life?



It's personal.



And this is therapy, where we share personal things.



You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?



See what you just did?



Trying to take control like that?



You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?



That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.



Let me ask you something, Sean.



Have you ever been close to anybody?



My foster father.



He's the only one who ever really knew me.



You're adopted?



Harry took me in when I was 3.



So tell me about Harry.



What kind of stuff did you guys do together?



You know, normal father-son stuff.



All right. Stop. Enough.



Are you all right?



I'm fine. I'm fine.



Nice ambush.



That was the perfect point of attack.



I can't believe I finally got you.



I won.



This isn't a game, Dexter.



No, I know.



It's not supposed to be fun.



Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --



You think I want to teach you these things?



This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!



This is about survival, Dex.



Nothing else.



Got it?



You've got a visitor, Perry.



You miss me?



Don't flatter yourself.



I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.



I confessed. What more do you need?



The evidence to line up.



We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.



Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.







It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.



Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.



Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?



Just covering my bases, Neil.



We both want the same thing.



10 minutes alone with Angelina?



To see you convicted.



What's in it for me if I help you do your job?



How about immortality?



We found your mother's body under your house.



Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --



Your choice.



If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.



I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.







You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.



If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.



Meridian had one thing right.



I do crave control.



The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.



Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.



Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --



At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."



Hey, I got it.



Thanks.



Hey, I know you --



Monday night at Meridian's.



You're always leaving your 7:00



when I'm arriving for my 8:00.



You missed last week, right?



No, I was there.



I don't remember ever seeing you, though.



How do you like him?



Meridian?



Best thing that's ever happened to me...



So far.



How about you? You finding him helpful?



I'm a sociopath.



There's not much he can do for me.



Cute and funny.



Let me guess



-- Taken.



Girlfriend.



Lucky girl.



Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.



All right.



So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.



My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.



Isn't that what therapy's all about?



Oh, my god.



I love your body.



I love your legs.



I love your arms.



I couldn't have made them better myself.



Are you crying?



I'm fine.



Then what?



I don't know.



I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.



Everything about you is hot.



Tell me what you're feeling.



It's...



It's just...



Every time I've ever been naked with someone...



...we just f*ck.



But not this time?



This is different.



It feels like...



I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.



It feels like making love.



Ew...



Yes.



But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.



What if I do?



Are you gonna cry about it?



You're so f*cked up.



What's up, rock star?



Look at you.



What you doing?



Where's the supervisor?



Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.



Who wants to play monster tag?



I do!



You?



I'm coming after you.



You better run.



Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.



I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.



It's your day off, right?



Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?



I have a lunch date with Dexter.



Come on. It'll be fun.



Mom, dad, come on!



I guess I could call Dexter.



It's official --



I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".



Here comes the monster.



Here comes the monster!



Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.



Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"



Or not.



Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.



Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?



What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?



Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.



It all points to su1c1de.



No chance it was m*rder?



Too bad, huh?



I had the husband pegged, too.



Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.



Try Craigslist.



I already did --



Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.



Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.



Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.



You seem on edge today.



I'm not getting what I came here for.



What'd you come here for?



We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.



Or feelings.



Heaven forbid.



So, what do you want to talk about?



Fakes --



People who pass themselves off as something they're not.



Like a pre-owned-car salesman?



A brave politician.



A Jew for Jesus.



A wolf in sheep's clothing.



Is that how you feel, Sean?



Like you're hiding a dark secret?



No, I wasn't talking about me.



Who you're talking about?



You.



That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.



You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.



Bingo.



You got me.



I do have another motive.



It's called a paycheck.



But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.



How are things at your job?



Frustrating, to tell you the truth.



What kind of forensics do you do?



Blood spatter.



Most people can't stand blood.



I hate it.



Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.



Yeah, it is, actually.



So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?



She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.



Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.



No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.



That way you never have to feel powerless.



So, then, what should I do?



Accept that certain things are out of your hands.



Let go.



Hey, Morgan --



I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.



What are you gonna do about it?



I wanted to k*ll him, dad.



It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.



I'm proud that you did that.



Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.



When's that gonna go away?



I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.



When's the story gonna run?



Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.



I just got to get back and write.



Thanks so much for your time.



How was your interview?



It was fine.



You ready to talk about the case?



Sure.



As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.



You just did.



Oh, give me a break.



That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.



In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.







Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.



It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.



I know your game, lieutenant.



You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.



You know what, Neil?



I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.



I found out how you got promoted.



Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.



How did you get...?



When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.



Just in case.



Only...



You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.



I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.



I deserved that promotion.



I'm sure you did.



It was a big bust.



Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.



You didn't catch me.



Your captain did.



At least that's what they're saying on the news.



My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.



Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.



Breaking and entering.



I hope he got my good side.



Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?



Goodbye, Dexter.



Hello, ladies.



I need another prescription.



I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.



Just one more, please.



We talked about this.



The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.



But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.



I can't even get out of f*cking bed.



I just -- I want to die.



Look at me.



I understand the appeal of death, okay?



No more pain.



All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.



In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.



su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.



How do most people do it?



Well, painkillers are the most common.



But they're entirely unreliable.



The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.



You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.



God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.



You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.



Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.



I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.



Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...



...okay?



It is now.



Okay, just, I wanted to see you.



I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.



I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.



No, of course not.



How'd it go?



Really good and incredibly scary.



For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.



Why is that scary?



Because...



I like my new life.



And I finally feel like I'm in control.



I never felt that way with Paul.



I do with you.



This is a disaster.



I chose Rita because she was damaged.



If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.



I'm ready, Dexter.



I don't know what I've been so afraid of.



You're the perfect boyfriend.



I want you to spend the night, for real.



I'm so sorry.



I came over here because I thought something was wrong.



But tonight's really not a good night.



I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.



Now? It's so late.



That's all the more reason to get back to work.



The clock's ticking. Here.



But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?



Okay.



sh*t.



I can't have sex with Rita.



Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --



Empty --



And then she's gone.



But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.



I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.



Stay where you are. I'm armed.



With bad puns?



You said you needed a favor. What's up?



Take off your pants.



Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.



You never ask me to come by before work.



No, but I like the way you think.



I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.



Like your mom?



Which is why I want to do something special for her.



I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --



Yours.



No.



Let me just take a cast.



No way, no.



It'll take 20 minutes, tops.



I don't --



Come on, please?



Stop being such a chick. Sit down.



Feels good.



Can I make one of your c*ck?



That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?



Not likely.



I haven't told anyone about us.



Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?



Not even a little.



Then why?



I guess this matters to me.



So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.



That Ret*rded?



No.



But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.



Seriously?



And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.



Where the hell you been?



With my boyfriend.



Boyfriend?



Yep.



We just f*cked in his office.



And we're having dinner tomorrow night.



You looking for me?



Yeah.



Shut the door.



Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?



No.



Nobody in the press?



Maria, we talked about this when it happened.



It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.



It's bad for both of us.



So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?



I guess.



We have to have our firewall checked.



She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...



...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.



It's okay, Sean.



Don't beat yourself up.



Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.



If she means something, why do I run away from her?







To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.



Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.



Yeah, I think you're right.



How can I change that?



Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.



Do you?



Of course I do.



Really?



And how do you deal with your wolf?



Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.



I made friends with it.



And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.



At least three times that we know about.



Can we get back to the sex thing?



This is all about sex.



The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.



No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.



That's not what I'm talking about.



Intimacy --



Really letting go face-to-face --



There's nothing more difficult than that.



The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.



What are you doing?



I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.



It might bring some things to the surface.



What kinds of things?



There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?



Foster child, no control over your destiny.



If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.



First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.



I want you to count each breath, okay?



In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.



This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.



Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.



Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?



Leave me alone, Josh.



I told you to walk away!



God damn it, Dexter.



There are consequences to everything you do in life.



Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.



I found the grave, son.



I'll be like this forever?



Mommy!



I have to get out of here.



Sean, come here.



Sean, Sean. Sean!



Oh, my god.



Are you okay?



Stay.



Stay with me.



You're sweet.



I am?



Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.



You want there to be a next time?



And a time after that.



Don't you?



No. I mean, yeah.



I just...



I didn't freak you out?



Why would you think that?



Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.



I really hope you came to apologize.



Nope. I came for a consult.



And you brought beverages?



I got this on loan from the morgue.



Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.



See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.



Can you?



Nope.



Really?



I think you can.



I mean, you chop people up, don't you?



Maybe you need a closer look.



No! Keep it away.



I talked to the medical examiner.



He couldn't confirm how your mom died.



Said it might have been a heart attack.



I k*lled her.



You don't have the b*lls.



I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.



And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.



Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?



Oh, f*ck you!



Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?



Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.



Oh, bullshit!



I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.



That's because you hacked into our computer system.



That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.



The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.



You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.



Nice touch, by the way.



Why are you doing this?



Because you're not a k*ller.



You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?



Maybe you need another look.



No, take it away.



All right, I lied, okay?



Just, I need you to take it away from me...



Please.



So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?



We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.



Yeah, about that trial --



I've got some bad news.



Perry recanted his confession this morning.



What are you talking about?



I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.



He's a wannabe, Tom.



Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.



How do you know which time he was lying?



All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.



We're going to trial.



All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.



It's up to the D.A.



I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.



The evidence is compelling.



We'll move forward with the trial as planned.



Fair enough.



If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.



I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?



I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.







You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.



I spent the night.



Face-to-face.



Sean!



That's very good.



It's all good, doctor.



I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.



You can't control other people, you know?



This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.



I am proud.



Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.



That's not true.



If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.



What do you want to focus on today?



Glad you asked that.



I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.



Okay.



I'm a serial k*ller.



Oh, god!



Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!



Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.



I'm not joking. I k*ll people.



There it is again.



You should try it.



I know.



Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.



I'm just kidding.



I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.



I don't know what you're talking about.



Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --



Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.



Those sessions are confidential!



I'm a control freak, I know.



But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --



dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.



No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.



You got quite the God complex.



This session's over.



Not so fast, doc.



You're awake.



Shall we analyze your dreams?



No. That's right.



You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?



You took powerful women and made them powerless.



They left behind families, children.



I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.



You've helped me make a major self-discovery.



The fact that I'm a k*ller...



...that's something I can't control.



You helped me to accept what I really am.



I'm grateful for that.



But...



I was raised with a certain set of principles.



I'm sorry, doc.



Actions have consequences, and this is yours.



I'm gonna have to let you go.



♪ My darling ♪

♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪

♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪

♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪



Hello?



Is that Eric Carmen?



No. What's up?



I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.



If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.



I never knew you were so a**l.



And I'm a neat freak.



You're just full of surprises, huh?



Oh, you have no idea.



I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?



Okay.



Barbie, be patient.



One day we'll share a cold one.
Previously on "Dexter"...



What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?



No, he's got unfinished business with me. "Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.



Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."



Paul called after you left.



He's already out of jail -- Overcrowding.



Can you believe it?



Are you f*cking my wife?



Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.



You want there to be a next time?



I just wish he'd go away.



Why can't he just go away and disappear forever?



I so want to maul you right now.



I so want you to.



It's different.



It feels like...



I hate saying this. It sounds f*cking cheesy.



It feels like making love. "Barbie, be patient. "One day we'll share a cold one."



Thank god for showers. Private time to think --



Harder to come by now that I'm in a real relationship.



Do you mind?



Not at all.



Could you pass the soap?



Yeah.



It's locked!



Mom, I got to pee!



I'll be right there, sweetie!



Hold on a second, buddy!



I can't!



Sorry. One-bathroom house.



Nature calls.



Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?



Cody!



Sword fight -- I won.



Mom, I got to brush.



Whatever happened to knocking?



I'm gonna be late for school.



You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna...



I mean, what does "separation" mean to you?



What "separation" means to me is that you're separated, and you work it out. Now, this was false pretenses.



I mean, I knew she wanted a divorce when she asked for the separation -- she lied.







Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.



Got it.



That's in the singular.



One.



Okay.



And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.



That's your problem. You're too damn honest.



She wouldn't even talk about it.



And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.



Forget that.



Stop the car, man!



What?



Stop the g*dd*mn car!



Stop! Police!



Doakes! Doakes!



You all right?



Yeah.



The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.



Haitian?



That'd be my guess.



All right. Let's go over it again.



I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.



I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.



Angel, you saw all this?



Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.



All right, and when you went under the causeway...



He took a shot at me.



I took cover and returned fire from that corner.



No, not from there.



Yeah, from f*cking right there.



But...



If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.



You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.



The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.



The man is a f*cking creep job!



James. Just focus on the facts, okay?



The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?



I'm good.



Yeah. You're up next.



Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.



He just got mixed up is all.



Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.



Trauma can distort the memory.



Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.



It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.



Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.



You really like using the "B" word, don't you?



Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.



Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.







I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.



Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!



Dex, Rudy's different.



I feel safe with him. I think...



I'm falling for him.



Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?



Right here.



Oh, that was easy.



An urgent registered letter?



Maybe you won a sweepstakes.



Dex, you got a second?



Yeah.



Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?



I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.



You still think Doakes'



version doesn't add up?



Blood never lies.



sh*t.



Listen, um...



Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?



Here.



Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.



Thanks.



You're welcome.



You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?



Dad died 10 years ago.



This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."



It's a will.



Well, he can't be your biological father.



Dad said he died before you came to live with us.



He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."



I'm your only next of kin.



Don't you f*cking forget it.



Oh, and I inherited a house.



I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.



He had to.



He was teaching me principles, a code.



He knew what I would become without it.



So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.



You know what this is?



This is Dexter's new birth certificate.



The adoption finally went through.



You're a Morgan now.



I thought I was already a Morgan.



Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.



It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.



This is an important day for us.



Hey, dad?



How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?



Well, they died.



I know, but how?



I don't know.



Let's not talk about it.



No, how did they die, dad?



It was an accident, a tragic accident.



So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?



Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...







And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.



That's odd.



Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.



And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.



Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?



You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.



Maybe.



It's too much for you to handle.



Yeah. I guess.



So I think I should come with you.



Oh, no, you don't have to do that.



Trust me. You'll need me.



I fell asleep.



Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.



So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?



No.



He's got to go to Dade City.



What's in Dade City?



I told you he was adopted, right?



Yeah.



Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.



Really?



Man.



It's a mistake, a big one.



Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.



When are you leaving?



Me?



I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.



I thought you two were close.



We are.



Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.



He doesn't need my help.



Or...



He doesn't know how to ask for it.



I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.



Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.







Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.



Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.



That's not your call.



The kids are already settled at Colleen's.



You can have your visit when we get back.



It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.



A death in the family trumps the circus.



Dexter is not your family. I am.



You ready?



Hey, Paul.



Better hit the road.



They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.



We had to eat them.



Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.



It's nice.



The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.



Are you my new neighbors?!



No.



No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.



So sad about Mr. Driscoll.



He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.



He used to clean my gutters every fall.



I don't know what I'm gonna do now...



Unless you know how to clean gutters.



We're not gonna be here for that long.



But, uh, you have a good day.



A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.



Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.



I don't want a house in Dade City.



Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.



And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.



Told you you'd need me.



Hey, James.



Hey, man.



I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.



Yeah.



There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.



It's pretty clear from where I was standing.



Yeah...



Except...



I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.



Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.







If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.



Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.



Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.



You saying I'm a liar?



No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.



This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.



Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.



You want to come at me, you come at me straight.



You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!



Angel.



I need to talk to you.



Help me out, man.



Is that Joe?



Must be.



It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...



But not really.



Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.



There's no family or kids' photos.



Lonely.



Dexter. Hi.



Hey.



Surprise.



I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...



Help while you deal with old wounds...



Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.



So it appears.



And this is Rudy.



I've waited a long time to meet you.



And you must be Rita.



Hi.



He came here for me -- For the both of us.



Isn't he great?



A lot of work to pack all this up.



Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.



The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?



It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.



I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.



We could stay here and save the money.



I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.



It's up to you, Dex.



Just say the word.



As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.



Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.



How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?



Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.



Coffee?



Thanks.



I've got to hit the morgue.



Want company?



No.



Thank you, though.



It's private.



I get it.



I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.



It appears so.



We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.



We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.



I'm not his son.



Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.



That's an interesting tattoo.



Joe said he picked that up in Nam.



You can be proud. He was a patriot.



Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.



Excuse me?



It's a prison tattoo.



It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.



It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.



Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.



He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.



How'd you determine cardiac arrest?



Was there damage to the coronary artery?



It's, uh, professional curiosity.



I work in forensics, down in Miami.



I see.



Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.



It's common with seizures during a heart attack.



It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.



Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.



Who knows what caused it --



Stress, inactivity...



French fries --



But knowing won't bring him back.



It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...



No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.



Yeah, this is really hard.



You mind if I just take a minute alone with...



Dad?



I'll be next door in my office.



Masuka.



Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.



Dude, I know your last name.



I need a favor, a DNA comparison.



I thought you were away with the girlfriend.



What? She surfing the Crimson wave?



I'm just helping out a local agency.



I'm gonna send you two blood samples.



I need it A.S.A.P.



Do a tox screen, will you?



Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.



Yeah.



Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.



What's his pressure?



It's 80 and dropping.



We may need to do a belly tap.



Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.



It hurts, dad.



What happened?



He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.



Is he gonna be all right?



We can keep him stable for a while.



But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.



Can we talk over here, please?



Dex, I'll be right back.



Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.



Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.



I don't want to talk about this.



Why are you being like this?!



You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.



Are you crazy?! He could die.



You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.



So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.







Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...



Mr. Bayard...



Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.



And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?



Well, the .38 wasn't mine.



And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.



Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?



Sergeant Doakes did.



Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?



Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?



I --



How the f*ck would I know that?



Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.



He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?



Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?



Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.



No records, no childhood photos...



The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.



You know, you're right.



He's right.



So, what happened between years one and 29?



Maybe he butchered his entire family.



Yeah...



Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.



The guy was a loser, after all.



Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?



What do you think, Dex?



I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.



Maybe he had to hide from them.



Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --



Narcotics anonymous.



Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.



Looks like Joe was clean for...



Let me guess --



30 years.



Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.



Nothing in his collection post-1980.



Got to love a purist.



Oh, good. Dancing.



Hello?



Hey, babe. It's Paul.



Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.



We're fine.



Everyone's fine, OK?



We'll see you on Monday.



No, no, no.



Talk to me.



You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.



Paul.



I would have.



I could have taken my kids to the circus.



We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.



Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.



Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.



Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.







Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.



Okay.



You're right.



I'm sorry.



You have a great weekend.



A secret life --



The only thing Joe and I have in common.



There's nothing else in this house to connect us.



Hiding out?



Cleaning up.



I can only imagine what you're going through.



A lot of lemon-fresh joy.



You joke.



It's good defense, by the way.



Thank you. I think.



Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.



What possibility?



That Joe could actually be your dad.



The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.



Or he lied.



Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.



I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?



Your dad fixed it.



See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.



It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.



But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.



You're very lucky.



Can I have a moment with my son?



Yeah.



Hey, Dex.



Everything's gonna be fine.



You'll be good as new.



I will?



Hey, would I lie to you?



When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --



Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."



That's all he asked.



I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.



Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.



But if I talk...



I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.



But if I lie --



Hold up.



Go ahead.



The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.



Also...



...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.



But he must have had good cause.



So Doakes fired first?



Doakes fired first.



I hope tuna's all right.



Mmm, love me a little mercury.



That's Dexter's.



Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.



Criminal -- I like it.



It's the station.



Morgan here.



Wait.



Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?



Freudian.



My subconscious has been exposed.



Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.



I got the results.



On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?



On the DNA test.



What DNA test?



You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?



Am I missing something?



DNA test?



Masuka called?



Your biological father was dead.



Dad told us that.



I remember.



So, the DNA came back negative?



It was a match.



Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.



Interesting.



Do you think dad... lied?



I think he might have known Joe was here...



...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.



Well, he must have had a damn good reason.



And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.



Deb, I'm not questioning anything.



That's why you got a tox screen, too.



I need to clear my head.



Where are your car keys?



Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.



You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.



It was professional curiosity.



Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...



I don't know, sleep.



That would surprise me.



Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.



It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.



Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.



Like?



Diabetic insulin.



It can cause cardiac arrest.



We've seen it before.



It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --



Jesus Christ!



He's not even your family!



Mom and dad were.



I am.



Are you gonna start questioning me now?



You? Why would I --



Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!



Doesn't that matter to you?!



I don't know what you want from me.



I want what dad wanted.



I want nothing to do with this guy.



Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!



All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?



I guess I understand why Deb is upset.



We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...



Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.



That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.



Howdy, neighbor.



Let me get that for you.



Well, thank you.



I was just wondering --



Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?



Visitors?



Oh, I'm not sure.



I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --



A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?



Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.



He was polite.



But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.



You remember what he looked like?



Well, he had dark hair...



Average height -- Normal, I suppose.



I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.



You lending I.A. a hand?



I just like to know what's going on in my department.



And what is going on?



Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.



Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.



Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?



Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.



But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.



What were they called?



Tonton Macoute.



Yeah, "the bogeymen."



They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.



They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.



They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.



This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.



Don't worry, James.



It'll be over soon.



I know it will.



If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...



Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.



If it's there, I'll find it.



Small towns.



Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?



Hey! You! stop! Come on!



Get in!



Heard you sneak out.



Took a guess where you were headed.



Figuring I'd need a ride?



Figured I could talk you out of it.



No such luck, huh?



Deb will be delighted.



As far as I know, you went out for a walk.



Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?



Well, my fingerprints were all over it.



I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.



It's just a box of ashes.



Joe was cremated, then?



Yep.



Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.



No.



What are you gonna do with him?



I don't know.



Hmm, dumpster?



I have a better idea.



You know...



No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.



Cardboard box?



I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.



But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.



My father.



Sounds strange.



I know.



You all right?



I was just getting some air.



Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.



It's just a bunch of papers.



They're over there.



Any clues?



Hey, buddy.



How you feeling?



Good.



It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.



Life's a trade-off.



What are you making there?



A thank-you card.



See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.



Who's it for?



Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.



I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?



Yes, it is.



It's just that he's gone.



And we won't be seeing him again.



I'm sorry.



That's all right.



It doesn't really mean anything.



Yeah, it does.



You keep drawing, son.



I'll make sure it finds him.



Okay.



You had the case dropped?



Excuse me.



I.A. dropped Doakes' case.



Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?



I put everything on the line.



I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.



What the hell happened?



Maria! I deserve to know.



All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.



What agency?



I'm guessing military.



They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.



They disappeared it.



I always knew Doakes had a history with them.



I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --



You think it was black ops, CIA?



Maybe.



Probably.



And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.



Angel...



You did what you thought was right.



Squeak, squeak.



Do you have a problem?



Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.



I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!



Yes, sir.



I'm sorry, sir.



I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.



Realtor says you won't get much for it.



More than if I kept it.



Are we good?



We're fine.



All right.



I'll see you back at the station.



Cable repair man.



Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.



Wait!



Please, I want to ask you something.



Wait!



Alone again.



Finally.



You know what?



I'm glad you were here.



Thought you would be.



The cable repairman --



Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!



No!



Rita, it's me.



They're asleep.



Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?



It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.



You don't call the sh*ts, okay?



Paul, I want you to leave.



I don't give a f*ck what you want.



I want my f*cking kids!



You're gonna scare them.



They don't want to see me?



Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.



You're right.



I've been awful.



I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.



But I can make it up to you.



Let me try.



Where are you going?



Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?



No! No!



f*cking whore.



Come on. Come on!



Wake up. Wake up. Come on.



I had a father...



Someone other than Harry who called me son.



The thought never even occurred to me.



Harry was all I needed.



It was Harry who always had the answers.



He knew who was good, bad, safe...



And dangerous.



I built my life on Harry's code.



I lived by it.



But Harry lied.



Why would he do that?



What else don't I know?



My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.



Maybe Rudy was right --



You never can truly know anyone.
Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.

Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.

Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.

But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.

I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

Previously on "Dexter"...

You still don't remember anything from before?

You know, before we took you in?

No.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

Mama!

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad.

And this is Rudy.

Dexter.

Hey.

I have waited a long time to meet you.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell's this guy thinking?

And the real king is still out there.

Hungry. Ready.

He'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think --

I'm falling for him.

Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

No!

f*cking whore!

Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday.

Can't be late Monday. Throws the whole week off.

What about breakfast?

Made and eaten.

And the kids' lunches?

Packed and ready to go.

Did you tell the locksmith?

Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven-pin keyways.

I want to talk to your mom for a sec.

Are you gonna make out?

None of your business.

Are you?

Astor.

Rita, you don't have to do this, you know.

Getting att*cked by your ex-husband merits a day off.

I'm fine.

I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore.

Those days are over.

It's gonna be okay. The police have been notified.

They'll find him.

What if they don't?

I got you some pepper spray.

Just aim for the eyes.

Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

I had some at Kirk's birthday,

10 days ago.

See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here.

Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think.

It started out vanilla.

Guys, you should look at this.

Put that thing down, for God's sake.

It was addressed to Homicide.

Put it down!

Jesus, is that blood?

Morgan, get your a*s over here.

a*s en route.

You're the blood expert. What is this sh*t?

It's a little watery for jam.

Maybe you should open it.

What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released?

I got to wash my hands.

So gullible.

What is it?

Well, it's definitely blood.

Wait, there's something in here.

Marina View hotel.

It's a key.

May be some sort of promotional gag.

You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood.

Show-and-tell's over.

Let's try and find out who sent this.

Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.

Batista's still working on the expl*si*n at the smack lab.

Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.

A jar of blood --

Dramatic, cryptic, playful.

Could it be him?

Got an extra key from the manager.

Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.

The guy who checked into 103

was white and normal looking.

I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here.

It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security.

Better be ready to cancel your lunch.

Police. Open up.

Oh, my God. Jesus. Get back in your room.

Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8

out at the Marina View hotel.

I need uniformed backup, forensics.

f*ck it. Just send everybody out.

It's been a while since we went prophylactic.

Not me. Last night, I met this chick --

I'll stop you right there, Vince.

So, they tell you anything about what's inside?

No one's been inside. Too much blood.

Dexter.

Just a heads-up -- It's bad in there.

Okay.

I'm serious.

Okay.

She's not kidding. It's your wet dream in there.

Okay.

You're going in first alone.

Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report. Don't f*ck up.

Now I'm really curious.

He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me?

Mommy!

Tell me you found something, Morgan.

I talked to the guests in room 105.

They didn't see anyone go in or out.

What about across the hall?

German tourists. They got their head up their lederhosen.

They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming.

Oh, my god!

Hey. Hey, you okay?

I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there.

Never should have skipped breakfast.

Bullshit. You're shaking. What the hell happened up there?

No, I'm okay. I just need a little air.

Something finally got to you.

I guess you're human after all.

Cut him some slack, all right?

I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar.

Tell us what you saw, Dex.

How many dead?

A lot.

But no bodies, just blood --

50, 60 liters.

Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know.

You're saying there was a mass m*rder in there, but they took the bodies?

How is that possible?

There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms.

Someone would have seen corpses coming out.

I don't f*cking know.

Hey, Dexter, you all right?

I can't go back in there.

You don't have to.

Fine.

Just get yourself cleaned up and --

I don't know -- Work from the hallway or something.

You're in room 422.

Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags.

Dade county sheriff's department.

I'm looking for Rita Bennett.

That's me. Did you find Paul?

I'm sorry?

Paul Bennett.

My ex-husband att*cked me last night.

My boyfriend filed a police report.

The only report we have is the one that Mr. Bennett filed.

What? Wait.

Paul filed a police report? For what?

as*ault. Your ex-husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital.

He's pressing charges against you.

He att*cked me!

Not according to him.

All right. Can we talk about this later?

We need a formal statement.

You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station.

Fine.

Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from. All right?

Sweet.

You should really get in here, Dex.

I never seen anything like this.

Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts.

Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue. Come see.

Photos, Vince.

Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting?

The blood's not clotting?

No.

Genuine medical mystery.

Just keep getting samples.

I'll test it at the lab.

Hello? Don't hang up.

Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station.

Paul's pressing as*ault charges against me.

How's it even possible? I was defending myself.

Just stay calm. I know a lawyer.

I'll straighten it out.

I am calm.

They're the hysterical ones.

They're charging me with a class-2 felony.

Hello, Dexter? Are you there?

Yeah, I'm right here.

This is ridiculous.

I could lose my job. I could lose my kids.

I won't let that happen.

Well, I'm glad you're so confident.

Rita, just trust me.

I know how the system works.

Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.

You okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Thank you.

Yeah, bye.

Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out.

What? A wall socket?

Yeah.

Of course there's a wall socket. There's lots of wall --

Hey, you're right.

There was something plugged in here -- probably a power tool to cut them up.

Come take a look.

Photos, Vince.

Lots and lots of photos.

Open Sesame.

Blood samples for the fridge.

And you better make room. There's a lot more coming.

sh**t at the Bel Canto tonight. You in?

I'm not in the mood.

Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central.

Look at this.

They were for Nina's birthday -- backstage passes to Neil Diamond.

You're in worse shape than I thought.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

Oh, Masuka was looking for you.

Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.

Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection.

A bit of an overshare.

You want to talk about what happened today?

Already did.

Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died.

Can talk to me, you know?

Just got to open your mouth and move it.

I'll call Rudy. I'll tell him I'll be late.

Deb, seriously.

I puked.

I'm fine.

I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do.

Why do you always do this?

Do what?

You shut me out!

Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you.

I still don't know how that makes you feel.

I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call.

Fine.

Whatever.

Did Paul force his way into the house?

No.

Did you ask him to leave?

Yes, and he refused.

But in your statement, it says you invited your ex-husband into your bedroom.

He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading --

Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

And you didn't want it to escalate. I understand that, but we can't prove intent.

Your ex-husband has the injuries here, not you.

Paul has a record of spousal abuse.

Spousal abuse can be mutual.

It was never mutual.

Okay.

But the man is a model parolee.

His drug tests are clean.

He's got glowing reports from the court-appointed supervisor.

Corrections will want to see this guy transition.

I don't care!

He's not going near my children. Do you understand?

Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children.

Now, you have deposition in two days.

Do not give this man any more amm*nit*on than he already has.

Okay.

Damn.

Just blood?

What happened to the bodies?

Hell if I know.

I don't want to know.

Blood was bad enough.

No wonder you seem so amped.

Your brother must have loved it.

f*ck no. He freaked.

Really?

I thought, you know, blood was his thing.

What happened?

I don' know. It was like usual. He shut me out.

Did he say anything?

Let's not talk about Dex right now.

Was it like a panic attack?

I don't know.

He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.

Kiss me.

What's the matter? You don't even have wood.

Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk.

Yeah, but not now. I'm horny.

Maybe I should call him.

Are you f*cking kidding me?

What? We -- We bonded last weekend.

Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family?

Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants.

Deb, that's not fair.

You take me out on a -- couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn?

I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.

You know what?

Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.

Okay. I'm gonna go watch  TV.

She loved him so g*dd*mn much.

She took every one of his CDs in the separation.

She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits.

Nina loved Neil Diamond. "Song Sung Blue." "September Morn."

Oh, my god -- "Kentucky Woman."

You got to love that sh*t.

That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.

Waitress! Is there a waitress?

I need a drink. Waitress!

Bro, you're a train wreck.

Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce.

I ain't ashamed.

Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.

Look...

Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask.

Comprendo?

Eighty-six the ring.

I have to take a squirt.

She's gonna f*ck me silly.

My sister's right. I don't share my problems with her...

Or with anybody.

Harry taught me that -- Secrecy, self-reliance, and a well-stocked cupboard of hefty bags.

Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage...

Until that boy in the blood.

He scares me. I want him to go away.

You awake?

What?

Are you sure you locked the door?

Yeah, I'm positive -- Bolt and chain.

What am I gonna do?

Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

And I will.

I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own.

Fortunately, Rita's has a name.

Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103

left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.

One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.

Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.

You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.

So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.

I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --

Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.

Previously on "Dexter"...

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

It's Paul. He...

He violated Florida's three-strikes law.

The cops picked him up totally strung out on heroin.

He's back in jail.

Holy sh*t! They're f*cking fingertips.

He started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

Menthol?

Like cough drops.

I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he...

Son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

I was confused because I love you.

What did you say?

I love you.

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

No, it's -- I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.

I need an ambulance at

1228 Calendar Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.

The same images running through my head over and over.

I was there.

I saw my mother's death.

A buried memory, forgotten all these years.

It climbed inside me that day.

And it's been with me ever since --

My dark passenger.

You should be focusing on me, socio.

Seriously want to get the m*therf*cker that did this to Batista.

I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.

How's he doing? Do we know?

Still in surgery.

Laguerta's there.

God, I hate feeling so helpless.

What, no jokes about providing gross sexual comfort in a time of crisis?

Our friend was stabbed...

And he might die.

Officer Morgan.

What do you think, Dex?

He put up a fight. There was a struggle.

Attaboy, Angel.

Here, this trail --

Steady stream of drops.

He had a few seconds. Tried to move away until -- till he fell.

So much blood.

What's happening to me?

No way.

You're the one I'm supposed to meet.

In the flesh.

You know, I was just talking to someone about you.

That tickles.

Don't stop.

I wouldn't dream of stopping.

You're so different this time --

Gentle.

Are you gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again?

Actually, your...

...imperfection is what saved you the first time.

Saved me from what?

True artistry.

The message of my work is -- not in the product itself, but rather the presentation.

That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.

It's quite unsightly, actually.

Hey, you don't have to be an as*h*le about it.

Hey, hey, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to offend.

Truthfully...

I'm thankful for you.

You're my escape plan.

Escape from what?

The police.

Because of you, I've had to speed up my... project.

I need something to distract them by.

And I always found a freshly chopped-up body always does the trick.

Wait, wait! No!

Don't struggle.

That never helps.

I'm compressing your carotid artery, and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.

In about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.

Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.

Okay, I guess you went to bed.

Or you fell asleep on the couch watching "Xena" reruns, which I still think makes you a dork.

Either way, call me when you get this, okay?

Miss you.

He's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.

So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.

No. I mean, I can't.

Alright. I understand.

You need to be there for your friend.

I haven't told the kids yet.

Told them about Angel?

No, about Paul...

Being back in prison?

I hate breaking their hearts. They think so much of their dad now.

Right.

You know what?

Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.

Thanks.

They're actually coming out right now. I got to go.

Angel sustained severe internal injuries.

He lost a lot of blood.

But... the surgery was successful.

It looks like our boy's out of the woods.

I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.

But I can't focus.

I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

I need to know what it means.

Morgan.

What the f*ck is wrong with you?

I have someplace I have to be.

Well, we all got someplace to be.

But you just found out that somebody who was supposed to be your friend is gonna live.

Does that make you feel anything?

Anything at all?

Take your f*cking hand off me.

Just what I always thought.

Right.

♪ Deck the halls with parts of bodies ♪

♪ La-da-da-da dum ♪

sh*t. Just what I need.

Hey.

I know it's late.

I guess you didn't get my message.

I drove by and saw your car.

I can go.

Get your a*s in here.

It's about time you see where I live anyway.

You have no idea how much I needed this.

You feel good.

And cold. You're freezing!

Well, then stay and keep me warm.

This Batista thing has gotten to you, hasn't it?

Angel's daughter was there.

That's got to be rough.

Daughter of a cop --

Just like you.

Yeah.

I remember what that's like --

Kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.

Let's get out of town for the weekend --

Just the two of us.

We need to talk.

I'm sitting right here.

Nope.

The time has got to be right.

Okay.

It'll have to wait...

At least till we catch the as*h*le who did this to Batista.

Let me warn you -- I can be very persistent.

I need to get out of town, and I need you... to come... with me.

What I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.

I'm totally wired from all this sh*t.

Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.

My loving arms.

And...

I got a little thing to help you sleep.

That ain't no little thing.

I meant Valium.

It's one of the perks working at the hospital.

Wine and Valium?

I'll be totally helpless.

You read my mind.

Well, as I live and breathe!

You miss me?

You and the bear claws you're hiding behind your back.

This must be important.

Haven't seen much of you lately.

No rest for the wicked.

How's Gene?

Good days and bad.

He just finished his first round of radiation.

Well, he's a good guy.

Not much of a bridge player, though.

Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and I would take them to the cleaners.

I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.

Well, sure thing.

Got a date?

Not exactly.

It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

I wish I could help, but... everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basement at City Hall.

And... as you can see, I'm up to my you-know-what in year-end reports, so...

It's my lieutenant.

Camilla, is there anything you remember?

What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his home and give you a loving family.

I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.

Who found the body parts?

I did.

They were left under the tree.

I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around...

Till I found the head.

I told him not to touch anything, but he never listens.

God, Patty, you're such a b*tch.

Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary before you found the body?

There were some broken ornaments by the tree.

Who could do something like this so close to Christmas?

The Grinch.

Oh, you're a f*cking riot, Max!

Like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this.

There go our jobs.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Oh, sucks to be an elf.

...Get some visual surveillance.

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim. Cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

Yep. And after the bloodbath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the press on this one.

James!

Yeah?

I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.

And will somebody turn off this g*dd*mn snow machine?!

Your sister can help you out.

That a whole sexual-tension thing or am I missing something?

103.

It's the same numbers he left at Marina View hotel.

Any leads as to what they mean?

We've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers

-- Nothing.

They need more to go on.

First he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.

Now he leaves me this --

A calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.

It doesn't make sense.

Crime scene's wiped clean.

Another hooker?

Ho, ho, ho -- Another dead ho.

Somebody's been naughty.

Hey, Morgan.

Want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for Christmas?

And he's back!

No, thanks.

Last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.

This doesn't seem right.

Body parts scattered among the presents.

Broken ornaments.

It's not his usual meticulous style.

It seems rushed...

Haphazard.

That would explain why we can't find one of the hands.

What's wrong?

There's something underneath the torso.

Merry Christmas, Miami.

After all this time, why do you think the ice-truck k*ller has struck again?

Any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.

Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?

None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?

After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.

Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.

Previously on "Dexter"...

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim, cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Dexter...

Laura Moser...

My mother.

Laura Moser and 3 others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

Angel was stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place.

You really don't want to do this.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

Yes, yes, yes.

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Where the f*ck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.

I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

I've lived in darkness a long time.

Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I don't have much time -- or, to be more accurate, my sister doesn't have much time.

He wants me to find him, but where do I look?

I can't think.

It's too bright.

Let me know if the tape's too tight.

You know, there's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

Why are you doing this?

Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.

Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Shh, I'm just checking the supplies, okay?

Things are moving a little faster than I had planned.

This isn't you.

Pretty sure it is.

No!

I know there's more -- I've seen it.

I never wanted to hurt you.

I know. I know.

Does this make it easier for you? Because I can keep going.

Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!

There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb. I mean, you're not the only one who bought it, okay?

Your name isn't even f*cking Rudy Cooper, is it?

Nope...

But he died for a good cause.

Yeah, so will you.

You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

Not some invisible hooker -- you kidnapped a cop!

It's all part of the plan.

Oh, Jesus.

It's hard to believe it's almost come to fruition.

I mean, this is a lot of years in the making.

We're only hours away.

He wouldn't have taken Deb unless he left me everything a clever monster would need in order to find them.

♪ Born free, ♪

♪ As free as the wind blows ♪

♪ As free as the grass grows ♪

♪ Born free to follow your heart ♪

Seems I have a new screen saver.

I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded, but "Born free"?

Of course.

Thanks to Rudy, now I know where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

Born free of all that's human --

That's where I'll find him.

She knows.

She knows.

All f*cking night with that.

She knows.

Listen, Angel, we need your help.

Masuka says you were following up a lead on the ice-truck k*ller when you were att*cked.

A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

John painted her nails different colors, but it didn't go nowhere.

Except she was just cut up by the ice-truck k*ller.

Holy sh*t. Monique was a victim?

Now, we're operating on the theory that he found out you were on his trail.

And if we're right, that means you got stabbed for a reason. It wasn't no carjacking.

How did he know it was me?

No one knew what I was doing except Masuka.

Someone else had to know. Think.

I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.

But that's crazy, right?

No, she's been AWOL since going out last night to meet him.

She was supposed to come back and help me canvass, but she never made it.

That's not like her.

Angel, we got to go.

Go, just go.

There are roughly 5,000 cargo containers in the port of Miami.

Finding the one where my mother was butchered took a bit of magic.

Busted.

Busted.

sh*t.

Just a second!

I told you he was here.

There some reason you're not answering your damn phone?

Ambien.

What happened here, Dexter?

I couldn't find the remote.

Where's your sister?

She didn't come back to work, and she's not at her apartment.

I honestly don't know, sergeant.

Dexter...

We think her boyfriend Rudy's connected to the ice-truck k*ller.

We're working on getting a search warrant right now to search his home.

No. Wow...

Cut the crap.

You know something. What?

James!

I saw him last night, skulking in the lab, ordering secret blood tests.

What kind of tests?

I was looking for a type match on the blood on Batista's collar.

And whose was it?

Rudy's.

m*therf*cker.

Knock it off!

He knew all along!

Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.

Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

It was just a wild hunch.

Why didn't you tell us?

I couldn't destroy Deb's love life on a hunch.

I had to get the facts.

Here are the facts: if he kills her, it's your fault. Now, what else do you know?

That's it.

He's lying.

Give him a break, James. It's his sister, all right?

Well, if he knows what's good for her, he'll sit his a*s at home and answer the f*cking phone when it rings.

Call if you hear anything.

Hello?

Please don't hang up.

Paul?

The kids don't want to talk to you, all right?

You got to give them more time.

This isn't about them.

It's about how I was arrested.

Yeah, with a needle in your arm -- I know all about it.

Well, I don't.

Listen, I take responsibility for all the sh*t I pulled, but, Rita, I was in the program.

I kicked the hard stuff.

Well, apparently not.

I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.

It's been driving me nuts how I got -- from your house one minute to the motel room the next, completely out of my mind on junk.

Yeah, it's called a blackout, Paul.

It's called a setup.

Well done.

The last thing I remember was standing in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

Now, he could have smacked me over the head and dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.

You really are a piece of work.

I'm telling you --

Dexter is not who you think he is.

Hello?

This one, I've got to make sure we got about seven copies of these.

I want to make sure it's distributed to everyone, okay?

Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.

Some of you may have met him.

He was dating officer Morgan.

Now, she was last seen 16 hours ago, driving to meet him at the Miami Beach marina.

So we need to canvass the entire area.

Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

I've already sent a team over to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

The judge just signed off on the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

Well, let's tear that place apart.

Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

Your attention, please.

I want to introduce you to our new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.

She agreed to put her vacation on hold, come in early, to provide us with some much-needed leadership at this critical time.

Lieutenant, you're on.

I understand we have a new suspect in the ice-truck k*ller case.

We're on our way over now to search his place.

And you are...

Maria Laguerta.

And we have an officer missing, so we need to move fast.

I thought that sergeant Doakes was running that investigation.

He's out following a lead.

What lead?

He said he'd let me know if it came to anything. Now if you excuse me --

I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

Who here can get me up to speed on the way over?

I can, I guess.

You're driving.

And feel free to join us when you locate your partner.

Would you like to come with us, captain?

You seem to have everything under control.

Let's go, people.

It's in there somewhere --

My birthplace.

Now what?

No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

With billions spent on Homeland Security, it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

So much for the w*r on terror.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

I don't like this place.

Something nameless was born here...

Something that lives in the deepest, darkest hole of the thing called "Dexter."

Get in there!

Somebody else -- Get in there now!

It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

Nothing will hurt you -- I promise.

Okay, Deb... don't be dead.

sh*t.

Surprise, m*therf*cker.

Are you following me now?

You better have a hell of a reason for being here.

I'm looking for my sister.

In a cargo box?

Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.

You forget you work for the f*cking cops?

We love theories. Spin me a story, as*h*le.

What I do on my time is my business, sergeant.

Yeah, me too, and I'm on my time now.

There's no lieutenant here to save your a*s, so don't f*ck with me, Morgan!

All right, you got me.

I ordered some furniture from Thailand.

I was waiting for it to be delivered.

Lab geek -- My a*s.

Hey, what the hell's going on over here?!

Security, I need to get somebody down here right now.

Miami metro P.D.

Yeah Is this guy under arrest?

That's a good question.

You're connected to this.

I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your a*s.

Let me out of here, m*therf*cker!

Let me out of here!

Let me out! Let me out! Let me out, you piece of sh*t!

Let me out of here, you f*cking piece -- Aah!

f*ck! Let me out!

Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio, and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

Bye!

His happy place, where he kills more than time --

This is where he'd leave me a clue.

Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.

I like the cold.

You know, hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.

Yeah, and so can hypochondria.

And a home setup like this would take years to put together.

He must have hated leaving it behind.

What are you looking for?

A clue, signature or calling card --

Anything that might give us a sense of where he went.

Well, I don't think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this.

I mean, look at this place.

Hey, you were right about the victim at Santa's cottage.

He rushed his work.

He k*lled that girl to keep us busy so he could escape, but he wouldn't go without leaving us a message.

We just need to find it.

Check this out.

This is where he played with his meat.

Pretty whacked out, huh?

I can think of 101

uses for this table.

Know what I mean?

He has my sister, Vince.

Right.

I mean -- I didn't mean -- I'm sorry.

sh*t.

You're Karen, right?

That's right.

You're in charge of evidence -- this entire room -- evidence.

Take photos of every item in its original position: work-kit, packages...

Show me the inventory list when you're done.

Is he in charge?

Guess he is now.

Rita?

Rita?

Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

Can I help you?

I guess Paul never mentioned me.

I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

Right.

So, having your sponsor do your dirty work --

Which step is that?

See, he's -- he's just concerned for the kids.

No, he's concerned for himself. If you'll excuse me...

I thought he was lying, too, until I saw the proof.

What proof?

Well, the X-rays the prison doctor took of Paul's head --

They showed a skull fracture.

Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

No. You didn't.

See, after you struck him, the hospital took X-rays -- No fracture.

But in prison, a fracture.

If you know Paul, you'd know he'd bash his own head against the wall to get what he wants.

Well, I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.

No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!

The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.

His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.

Previously on "Dexter"..

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again.

Has to happen.

There he is. He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

You better be a cop.

No... Forensics.

There is no blood near the body at all.

It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

One of these days, you're gonna tell me.

I told you blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

How the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Please, you have to understand.

Trust me. I definitely understand.

Hello?

What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

They found another hooker.

Another one?

That's the third one in five months.

Third? You mean there's a...

Serial k*ller, that's right.

Dex, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Of course, you have to learn how to spot them, but I can teach you.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.

Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".

Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.

Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.

Previously on "Dexter"...

What happened changed something inside you, Dex.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

What can I do to help?

No blood. What a beautiful idea.

Refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "hey, want to play?"

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.

We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.

Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.

Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.

As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?

Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.

However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood. What a gorgeous idea.

Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold environment... to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man. You did... when you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam. You in?

Hey, man. Sounds good.

I thought you said you wanted to go get sh*t-faced.

I am sh*t-faced.

I showed my face to Guerrero, to his whole church.

They're gonna think I'm behind this sh*t.

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

He's escalating the thrill, posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show us what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Fingertips.

f*ckin' as*h*le, that's my girl.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

I find people around me are always making some kind of connection, like friendship or romance, but human bonds always lead to messy complications... commitment, sharing, driving people to the airport.

Besides, if I let someone get that close,

So, time to put on my mask.

I need your expertise.

I live to serve.

Excuse us, fellas.

Interesting hand job.

That's funny.

It is?

So, how long you think it's been there?

This feels familiar.

Okay. So, how long has it been there?

Blood stopped pooling, still wet... couple hours at the most.

What time was it found?

A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.

No prints. Wiped clean. Real creep show, huh?

Any sign of the rest of the body?

Just Mr. Hand. Do you think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

It's hard to say. There's blood. That's different.

Plus, it's a male victim-- haven't seen that before.

The cut appears to be almost delicate.

You see between the first and second row of carpals...

Very surgical.

Check out what else he left behind.

A little postcard to remember him by.

How far is Rand Beach from here?

This is Rand Beach.

It was renamed Petrie Beach a few years ago.

Okay, everybody.

Everybody say "stinky feet".

Stinky feet!

Wait. Nobody move. Dexter, were you smiling?

No.

Okay, we'll do another one.

This time, everybody smiles. You, too, Dex.

Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.

Shut your damn face, Deb.

Hey, language, please.

What? She always talks like that.

Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.

What's your problem?

I hate the beach.

It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.

Too bad. You're part of a family.

And being part of a family means smiling for photos.

Why should I pretend I'm happy?

Because it'll make your mom happy, and because it's how you fit in.

Remember we talked about that?

Yeah.

This is how you do it.

When somebody takes your picture, you smile.

It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

You just do it to fit in. Okay?

Okay.

All right.

Come here, handsome.

Okay. Everybody ready? One more time.

Stinky feet!

Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.

Straight to the station after, yeah. Thanks, lieutenant.

Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...

Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.

Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...

Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.

Previously on "Dexter"...

Think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

It's the guard-- Tucci.

I think he's alive.

Tucci's alive?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

He's sending me a message.

He wants me to go there.

Please.

He was left here so I would k*ll him.

Just k*ll me.

I can't k*ll this man.

Taking Tucci over to County alive.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

The thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be. I'm Dexter.

I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone, maybe post-apocalypse or plague, Whatever-- No one left to act normal for, no need to hide who I really am.

It would be

...freeing.

Stop grinning like a f*cking psycho and get back to work.

Sorry, sergeant.

I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before I tear the bed apart.

I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

My shadow companion chose this place well.

This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.

All these people pawing over it seems...

He was here for days, playing with sharp objects.

I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless, amazingly so.

The only blood I found belongs to the security guard.

Has he said anything yet?

Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

Lieutenant, up here!

There's got to be something here. Find it.

The guy's not a ghost. Tony Tucci is evidence of that.

Hey, Dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet?

It's like sh**ting a Jackson Pollock.

Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.

Ready?

Okay.

What was that?

Did you see that?

What?

Damn rats.

We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their sh*t in the dust.

We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.

Lovely. Can we get the lights, guys?

You ever heard of rat-bite fever?

Masuka, what'd I say about the f*cking rats?

You haven't found anything, won't find anything.

This is a bust, right?

In so many words.

Which means I'm just jerking off till Tucci wakes up.

So take a break. You've been working this thing 24-7.

Or are you still avoiding a personal life?

Oh, f*ck you.

And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.

Thanks, guys.

It doesn't have to be either/or.

Maybe not for you.

If I found someone, so can you, right?

Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

Tell me about it.

Yelina? Are you okay?

I'm sorry. I'm fine.

Ernesto hasn't arrived?

I'm sure he'll be here soon.

No.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Coyote?

You mean the man you paid to bring him here?

He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.

But that was a week ago, and no one in Cárdenas has heard from Ernesto.

Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

...This was his number, but it's not working anymore.

I was supposed to leave him money in a park.

Listen, my boyfriend works for the police. I'm sure he--

No, no, no. We can't go to the police.

He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba.

No, it's okay. It's okay. Dexter will know what to do.

I feel just terrible for her.

And they were supposed to be married after he got here.

I do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues.

I can talk to him.

That's really kind of you, Dex.

I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your fiancée is dead or alive?

Uh, no.

Every night after work Yelina goes across the street, to the beach.

I've seen her there, just... staring out at the water, willing him to walk out of it.

Have you ever longed for anything like that?

She wants something from me. Ever since the blow job, she assumes we've taken it to the next level.

She doesn't know yet-- I don't have a next level.

Well, when I was a kid, I would have k*lled for an Atari.

You know?

Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man...

It always comes to this once sex is introduced.

Small talk no longer cuts it.

Eventually she'll call me a science project and slam the door in my face.

But when do you think he'll wake up?

Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a k*ller out there that's into whores and security guards, but I'll bet nurses are next.

Yo, check you, all "MPD Blue".

Shanda, what are you doing here?

You have another lead on the ice-truck k*ller?

Man, I got bigger worries than that sick sh*t.

Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?

I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what you're after.

Oh, hell, no.

But my landlord's another f*cking story--

Trying to kick me out of my home.

Shanda.

He got no cause, except he's a born-again hypocrite m*therf*cker.

Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?

No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.

Morgan. Found this in evidence.

Masuka was gonna grease it through.

A cigarette butt?

Jesus, we could pull DNA off of that, or even a print.

Except it would be your print.

You were smoking on a crime scene.

Not on the crime scene-- like on the way-far end of the park.

The whole area's a crime scene. You should know that by now.

Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.

Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.

Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.

Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.

I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.

Previously on "Dexter"...

Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.

Hey, Angel, I got him!

They really found the ice-truck k*ller?

I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.

Son of a b*tch.

I have so many questions for him.

What was his message to me?

Now I need to know him.

Hi.

The f*ck are you?

Paul Bennett. Father on parole.

Dexter Morgan.

I can't think of anything clever to say.

Divorce papers -- Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I'd better make the most of them.

Your instincts were dead-on.

They're always dead-on when it comes to K*llers. Why is that?

I'm watchin' you.

What are we looking at here?

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

You?

No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?

Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you?

I like seafood.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

Not as hard as her.

Damn power outages.

I don't know, Angel.

Most firearm suicides are committed by men.

Women tend to slash their wrists, take pills, something more ladylike.

Not in Miami.

We closed a couple of su1c1de cases just like this last year, remember?

Look at this mess.

That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?

House husband. And aspiring artist.

Promising.

So, she supported him?

It looks like that.

She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

Those other suicides we closed -- those were high-powered women too, right?

I don't know. I think so.

Note to self.

I don't care what it looks like. Somebody k*lled her.

We're checking out all the possibilities, Mr. Gayle.

Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem?

You know, job stress, the usual, but she was working through it in therapy.

She have any other problems that you're aware of? Threats?

Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.

I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.

You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.

Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?

To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.

You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪

♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪

♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪

♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.

Previously on "Dexter"...

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No, he's got unfinished business with me. "Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."

Paul called after you left.

He's already out of jail -- Overcrowding.

Can you believe it?

Are you f*cking my wife?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

I just wish he'd go away.

Why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you to.

It's different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love. "Barbie, be patient. "One day we'll share a cold one."

Thank god for showers. Private time to think --

Harder to come by now that I'm in a real relationship.

Do you mind?

Not at all.

Could you pass the soap?

Yeah.

It's locked!

Mom, I got to pee!

I'll be right there, sweetie!

Hold on a second, buddy!

I can't!

Sorry. One-bathroom house.

Nature calls.

Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?

Cody!

Sword fight -- I won.

Mom, I got to brush.

Whatever happened to knocking?

I'm gonna be late for school.

You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna...

I mean, what does "separation" mean to you?

What "separation" means to me is that you're separated, and you work it out. Now, this was false pretenses.

I mean, I knew she wanted a divorce when she asked for the separation -- she lied.

Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.

I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...

And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.

Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.

If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.

Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.

Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.

Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.

Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.

But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.

I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.

One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.

Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.

You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.

So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.

I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --

Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.

Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?

None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?

After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.

Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.

No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!

The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.

His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.

Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".

Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.

Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.

We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.

Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.

Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.

As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?

Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.

However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.

Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...

Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.

Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...

Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.

Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.

Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.

Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.

Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.

I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.

Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.

I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.

You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.

Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?

To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.

You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪

♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪

♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪

♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.

Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.

I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...

And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.

Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.

If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.

Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.

Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.

Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.

Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.

But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.

I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.

One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.

Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.

You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.

So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.

I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --

Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.

Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?

None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?

After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.

Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.

No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!

The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

♪ Ring around the rosie ♪

♪ A pocket full of posies ♪

♪ Ashes, ashes ♪

♪ We all fall down! ♪

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.

His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.

Previously on "Dexter"..

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again.

Has to happen.

There he is. He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

You better be a cop.

No... Forensics.

There is no blood near the body at all.

It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

One of these days, you're gonna tell me.

I told you blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

How the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Please, you have to understand.

Trust me. I definitely understand.

Hello?

What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

They found another hooker.

Another one?

That's the third one in five months.

Third? You mean there's a...

Serial k*ller, that's right.

Dex, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Of course, you have to learn how to spot them, but I can teach you.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.

Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".

Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.

Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.

We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.

Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.

Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.

As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?

Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.

However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.

Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...

Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.

Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...

Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.

Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.

Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.

Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.

Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.

I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.

Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.

I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.

You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.

Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?

To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.

You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪

♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪

♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪

♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.

Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.

I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...

And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.

Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.

If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.

Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.

Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.

Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.

Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.

But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.

I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.

One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.

Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.

You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.

So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.

I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --

Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.

Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?

None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?

After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.

Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.

No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!

The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

♪ Ring around the rosie ♪

♪ A pocket full of posies ♪

♪ Ashes, ashes ♪

♪ We all fall down! ♪

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.

His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.

Previously on "Dexter"..

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again.

Has to happen.

There he is. He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

You better be a cop.

No... Forensics.

There is no blood near the body at all.

It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

One of these days, you're gonna tell me.

I told you blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

How the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Please, you have to understand.

Trust me. I definitely understand.

Hello?

What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

They found another hooker.

Another one?

That's the third one in five months.

Third? You mean there's a...

Serial k*ller, that's right.

Dex, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Of course, you have to learn how to spot them, but I can teach you.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

♪ ven conmigo... ♪

♪ junto a mi corazón ♪

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.

Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".

Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.

Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.

We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.

Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.

Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.

As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?

Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.

However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.

Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...

Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.

Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...

Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.

Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.

Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.

Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.

Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.

I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.

Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.

I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.

You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.

Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?

To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.

You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪

♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪

♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪

♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.

Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.

I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...

And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.

Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.

If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.

Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.

Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.

Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.

Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.

But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.

I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

Previously on "Dexter"...

You still don't remember anything from before?

You know, before we took you in?

No.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

Mama!

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad.

And this is Rudy.

Dexter.

Hey.

I have waited a long time to meet you.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell's this guy thinking?

And the real king is still out there.

Hungry. Ready.

He'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think --

I'm falling for him.

Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

No!

f*cking whore!

Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday.

Can't be late Monday. Throws the whole week off.

What about breakfast?

Made and eaten.

And the kids' lunches?

Packed and ready to go.

Did you tell the locksmith?

Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven-pin keyways.

I want to talk to your mom for a sec.

Are you gonna make out?

None of your business.

Are you?

Astor.

Rita, you don't have to do this, you know.

Getting att*cked by your ex-husband merits a day off.

I'm fine.

I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore.

Those days are over.

It's gonna be okay. The police have been notified.

They'll find him.

What if they don't?

I got you some pepper spray.

Just aim for the eyes.

Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

I had some at Kirk's birthday,

10 days ago.

See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here.

Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think.

It started out vanilla.

Guys, you should look at this.

Put that thing down, for God's sake.

It was addressed to Homicide.

Put it down!

Jesus, is that blood?

Morgan, get your a*s over here.

a*s en route.

You're the blood expert. What is this sh*t?

It's a little watery for jam.

Maybe you should open it.

What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released?

I got to wash my hands.

So gullible.

What is it?

Well, it's definitely blood.

Wait, there's something in here.

Marina View hotel.

It's a key.

May be some sort of promotional gag.

You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood.

Show-and-tell's over.

Let's try and find out who sent this.

Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.

Batista's still working on the expl*si*n at the smack lab.

Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.

A jar of blood --

Dramatic, cryptic, playful.

Could it be him?

Got an extra key from the manager.

Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.

The guy who checked into 103

was white and normal looking.

I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here.

It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security.

Better be ready to cancel your lunch.

Police. Open up.

Oh, my God. Jesus. Get back in your room.

Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8

out at the Marina View hotel.

I need uniformed backup, forensics.

f*ck it. Just send everybody out.

It's been a while since we went prophylactic.

Not me. Last night, I met this chick --

I'll stop you right there, Vince.

So, they tell you anything about what's inside?

No one's been inside. Too much blood.

Dexter.

Just a heads-up -- It's bad in there.

Okay.

I'm serious.

Okay.

She's not kidding. It's your wet dream in there.

Okay.

You're going in first alone.

Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report. Don't f*ck up.

Now I'm really curious.

He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me?

Mommy!

Tell me you found something, Morgan.

I talked to the guests in room 105.

They didn't see anyone go in or out.

What about across the hall?

German tourists. They got their head up their lederhosen.

They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming.

Oh, my god!

Hey. Hey, you okay?

I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there.

Never should have skipped breakfast.

Bullshit. You're shaking. What the hell happened up there?

No, I'm okay. I just need a little air.

Something finally got to you.

I guess you're human after all.

Cut him some slack, all right?

I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar.

Tell us what you saw, Dex.

How many dead?

A lot.

But no bodies, just blood --

50, 60 liters.

Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know.

You're saying there was a mass m*rder in there, but they took the bodies?

How is that possible?

There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms.

Someone would have seen corpses coming out.

I don't f*cking know.

Hey, Dexter, you all right?

I can't go back in there.

You don't have to.

Fine.

Just get yourself cleaned up and --

I don't know -- Work from the hallway or something.

You're in room 422.

Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags.

Dade county sheriff's department.

I'm looking for Rita Bennett.

That's me. Did you find Paul?

I'm sorry?

Paul Bennett.

My ex-husband att*cked me last night.

My boyfriend filed a police report.

The only report we have is the one that Mr. Bennett filed.

What? Wait.

Paul filed a police report? For what?

as*ault. Your ex-husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital.

He's pressing charges against you.

He att*cked me!

Not according to him.

All right. Can we talk about this later?

We need a formal statement.

You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station.

Fine.

Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from. All right?

Sweet.

You should really get in here, Dex.

I never seen anything like this.

Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts.

Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue. Come see.

Photos, Vince.

Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting?

The blood's not clotting?

No.

Genuine medical mystery.

Just keep getting samples.

I'll test it at the lab.

Hello? Don't hang up.

Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station.

Paul's pressing as*ault charges against me.

How's it even possible? I was defending myself.

Just stay calm. I know a lawyer.

I'll straighten it out.

I am calm.

They're the hysterical ones.

They're charging me with a class-2 felony.

Hello, Dexter? Are you there?

Yeah, I'm right here.

This is ridiculous.

I could lose my job. I could lose my kids.

I won't let that happen.

Well, I'm glad you're so confident.

Rita, just trust me.

I know how the system works.

Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.

You okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Thank you.

Yeah, bye.

Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out.

What? A wall socket?

Yeah.

Of course there's a wall socket. There's lots of wall --

Hey, you're right.

There was something plugged in here -- probably a power tool to cut them up.

Come take a look.

Photos, Vince.

Lots and lots of photos.

Open Sesame.

Blood samples for the fridge.

And you better make room. There's a lot more coming.

sh**t at the Bel Canto tonight. You in?

I'm not in the mood.

Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central.

Look at this.

They were for Nina's birthday -- backstage passes to Neil Diamond.

You're in worse shape than I thought.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

Oh, Masuka was looking for you.

Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.

Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection.

A bit of an overshare.

You want to talk about what happened today?

Already did.

Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died.

Can talk to me, you know?

Just got to open your mouth and move it.

I'll call Rudy. I'll tell him I'll be late.

Deb, seriously.

I puked.

I'm fine.

I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do.

Why do you always do this?

Do what?

You shut me out!

Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you.

I still don't know how that makes you feel.

I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call.

Fine.

Whatever.

Did Paul force his way into the house?

No.

Did you ask him to leave?

Yes, and he refused.

But in your statement, it says you invited your ex-husband into your bedroom.

He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading --

Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

And you didn't want it to escalate. I understand that, but we can't prove intent.

Your ex-husband has the injuries here, not you.

Paul has a record of spousal abuse.

Spousal abuse can be mutual.

It was never mutual.

Okay.

But the man is a model parolee.

His drug tests are clean.

He's got glowing reports from the court-appointed supervisor.

Corrections will want to see this guy transition.

I don't care!

He's not going near my children. Do you understand?

Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children.

Now, you have deposition in two days.

Do not give this man any more amm*nit*on than he already has.

Okay.

Damn.

Just blood?

What happened to the bodies?

Hell if I know.

I don't want to know.

Blood was bad enough.

No wonder you seem so amped.

Your brother must have loved it.

f*ck no. He freaked.

Really?

I thought, you know, blood was his thing.

What happened?

I don' know. It was like usual. He shut me out.

Did he say anything?

Let's not talk about Dex right now.

Was it like a panic attack?

I don't know.

He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.

Kiss me.

What's the matter? You don't even have wood.

Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk.

Yeah, but not now. I'm horny.

Maybe I should call him.

Are you f*cking kidding me?

What? We -- We bonded last weekend.

Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family?

Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants.

Deb, that's not fair.

You take me out on a -- couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn?

I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.

You know what?

Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.

Okay. I'm gonna go watch  TV.

She loved him so g*dd*mn much.

She took every one of his CDs in the separation.

She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits.

Nina loved Neil Diamond. "Song Sung Blue." "September Morn."

Oh, my god -- "Kentucky Woman."

You got to love that sh*t.

That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.

Waitress! Is there a waitress?

I need a drink. Waitress!

Bro, you're a train wreck.

Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce.

I ain't ashamed.

Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.

Look...

Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask.

Comprendo?

Eighty-six the ring.

I have to take a squirt.

She's gonna f*ck me silly.

My sister's right. I don't share my problems with her...

Or with anybody.

Harry taught me that -- Secrecy, self-reliance, and a well-stocked cupboard of hefty bags.

Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage...

Until that boy in the blood.

He scares me. I want him to go away.

You awake?

What?

Are you sure you locked the door?

Yeah, I'm positive -- Bolt and chain.

What am I gonna do?

Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

And I will.

I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own.

Fortunately, Rita's has a name.

Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103

left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.

One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.

Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.

You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.

So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.

I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --

Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.

Previously on "Dexter"...

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

It's Paul. He...

He violated Florida's three-strikes law.

The cops picked him up totally strung out on heroin.

He's back in jail.

Holy sh*t! They're f*cking fingertips.

He started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

Menthol?

Like cough drops.

I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he...

Son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

I was confused because I love you.

What did you say?

I love you.

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

No, it's -- I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.

I need an ambulance at

1228 Calendar Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.

The same images running through my head over and over.

I was there.

I saw my mother's death.

A buried memory, forgotten all these years.

It climbed inside me that day.

And it's been with me ever since --

My dark passenger.

You should be focusing on me, socio.

Seriously want to get the m*therf*cker that did this to Batista.

I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.

How's he doing? Do we know?

Still in surgery.

Laguerta's there.

God, I hate feeling so helpless.

What, no jokes about providing gross sexual comfort in a time of crisis?

Our friend was stabbed...

And he might die.

Officer Morgan.

What do you think, Dex?

He put up a fight. There was a struggle.

Attaboy, Angel.

Here, this trail --

Steady stream of drops.

He had a few seconds. Tried to move away until -- till he fell.

So much blood.

What's happening to me?

No way.

You're the one I'm supposed to meet.

In the flesh.

You know, I was just talking to someone about you.

That tickles.

Don't stop.

I wouldn't dream of stopping.

You're so different this time --

Gentle.

Are you gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again?

Actually, your...

...imperfection is what saved you the first time.

Saved me from what?

True artistry.

The message of my work is -- not in the product itself, but rather the presentation.

That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.

It's quite unsightly, actually.

Hey, you don't have to be an as*h*le about it.

Hey, hey, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to offend.

Truthfully...

I'm thankful for you.

You're my escape plan.

Escape from what?

The police.

Because of you, I've had to speed up my... project.

I need something to distract them by.

And I always found a freshly chopped-up body always does the trick.

Wait, wait! No!

Don't struggle.

That never helps.

I'm compressing your carotid artery, and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.

In about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.

Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.

Okay, I guess you went to bed.

Or you fell asleep on the couch watching "Xena" reruns, which I still think makes you a dork.

Either way, call me when you get this, okay?

Miss you.

He's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.

So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.

No. I mean, I can't.

Alright. I understand.

You need to be there for your friend.

I haven't told the kids yet.

Told them about Angel?

No, about Paul...

Being back in prison?

I hate breaking their hearts. They think so much of their dad now.

Right.

You know what?

Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.

Thanks.

They're actually coming out right now. I got to go.

Angel sustained severe internal injuries.

He lost a lot of blood.

But... the surgery was successful.

It looks like our boy's out of the woods.

I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.

But I can't focus.

I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

I need to know what it means.

Morgan.

What the f*ck is wrong with you?

I have someplace I have to be.

Well, we all got someplace to be.

But you just found out that somebody who was supposed to be your friend is gonna live.

Does that make you feel anything?

Anything at all?

Take your f*cking hand off me.

Just what I always thought.

Right.

♪ Deck the halls with parts of bodies ♪

♪ La-da-da-da dum ♪

sh*t. Just what I need.

Hey.

I know it's late.

I guess you didn't get my message.

I drove by and saw your car.

I can go.

Get your a*s in here.

It's about time you see where I live anyway.

You have no idea how much I needed this.

You feel good.

And cold. You're freezing!

Well, then stay and keep me warm.

This Batista thing has gotten to you, hasn't it?

Angel's daughter was there.

That's got to be rough.

Daughter of a cop --

Just like you.

Yeah.

I remember what that's like --

Kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.

Let's get out of town for the weekend --

Just the two of us.

We need to talk.

I'm sitting right here.

Nope.

The time has got to be right.

Okay.

It'll have to wait...

At least till we catch the as*h*le who did this to Batista.

Let me warn you -- I can be very persistent.

I need to get out of town, and I need you... to come... with me.

What I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.

I'm totally wired from all this sh*t.

Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.

My loving arms.

And...

I got a little thing to help you sleep.

That ain't no little thing.

I meant Valium.

It's one of the perks working at the hospital.

Wine and Valium?

I'll be totally helpless.

You read my mind.

Well, as I live and breathe!

You miss me?

You and the bear claws you're hiding behind your back.

This must be important.

Haven't seen much of you lately.

No rest for the wicked.

How's Gene?

Good days and bad.

He just finished his first round of radiation.

Well, he's a good guy.

Not much of a bridge player, though.

Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and I would take them to the cleaners.

I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.

Well, sure thing.

Got a date?

Not exactly.

It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

I wish I could help, but... everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basement at City Hall.

And... as you can see, I'm up to my you-know-what in year-end reports, so...

It's my lieutenant.

Camilla, is there anything you remember?

What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his home and give you a loving family.

I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.

Who found the body parts?

I did.

They were left under the tree.

I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around...

Till I found the head.

I told him not to touch anything, but he never listens.

God, Patty, you're such a b*tch.

Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary before you found the body?

There were some broken ornaments by the tree.

Who could do something like this so close to Christmas?

The Grinch.

Oh, you're a f*cking riot, Max!

Like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this.

There go our jobs.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Oh, sucks to be an elf.

...Get some visual surveillance.

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim. Cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

Yep. And after the bloodbath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the press on this one.

James!

Yeah?

I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.

And will somebody turn off this g*dd*mn snow machine?!

Your sister can help you out.

That a whole sexual-tension thing or am I missing something?

103.

It's the same numbers he left at Marina View hotel.

Any leads as to what they mean?

We've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers

-- Nothing.

They need more to go on.

First he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.

Now he leaves me this --

A calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.

It doesn't make sense.

Crime scene's wiped clean.

Another hooker?

Ho, ho, ho -- Another dead ho.

Somebody's been naughty.

Hey, Morgan.

Want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for Christmas?

And he's back!

No, thanks.

Last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.

This doesn't seem right.

Body parts scattered among the presents.

Broken ornaments.

It's not his usual meticulous style.

It seems rushed...

Haphazard.

That would explain why we can't find one of the hands.

What's wrong?

There's something underneath the torso.

Merry Christmas, Miami.

After all this time, why do you think the ice-truck k*ller has struck again?

Any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.

Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?

None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?

After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.

Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.

Previously on "Dexter"...

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim, cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Dexter...

Laura Moser...

My mother.

Laura Moser and 3 others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

Angel was stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place.

You really don't want to do this.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

Yes, yes, yes.

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Where the f*ck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.

I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

I've lived in darkness a long time.

Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I don't have much time -- or, to be more accurate, my sister doesn't have much time.

He wants me to find him, but where do I look?

I can't think.

It's too bright.

Let me know if the tape's too tight.

You know, there's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

Why are you doing this?

Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.

Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Shh, I'm just checking the supplies, okay?

Things are moving a little faster than I had planned.

This isn't you.

Pretty sure it is.

No!

I know there's more -- I've seen it.

I never wanted to hurt you.

I know. I know.

Does this make it easier for you? Because I can keep going.

Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!

There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb. I mean, you're not the only one who bought it, okay?

Your name isn't even f*cking Rudy Cooper, is it?

Nope...

But he died for a good cause.

Yeah, so will you.

You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

Not some invisible hooker -- you kidnapped a cop!

It's all part of the plan.

Oh, Jesus.

It's hard to believe it's almost come to fruition.

I mean, this is a lot of years in the making.

We're only hours away.

He wouldn't have taken Deb unless he left me everything a clever monster would need in order to find them.

♪ Born free, ♪

♪ As free as the wind blows ♪

♪ As free as the grass grows ♪

♪ Born free to follow your heart ♪

Seems I have a new screen saver.

I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded, but "Born free"?

Of course.

Thanks to Rudy, now I know where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

Born free of all that's human --

That's where I'll find him.

She knows.

She knows.

All f*cking night with that.

She knows.

Listen, Angel, we need your help.

Masuka says you were following up a lead on the ice-truck k*ller when you were att*cked.

A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

John painted her nails different colors, but it didn't go nowhere.

Except she was just cut up by the ice-truck k*ller.

Holy sh*t. Monique was a victim?

Now, we're operating on the theory that he found out you were on his trail.

And if we're right, that means you got stabbed for a reason. It wasn't no carjacking.

How did he know it was me?

No one knew what I was doing except Masuka.

Someone else had to know. Think.

I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.

But that's crazy, right?

No, she's been AWOL since going out last night to meet him.

She was supposed to come back and help me canvass, but she never made it.

That's not like her.

Angel, we got to go.

Go, just go.

There are roughly 5,000 cargo containers in the port of Miami.

Finding the one where my mother was butchered took a bit of magic.

Busted.

Busted.

sh*t.

Just a second!

I told you he was here.

There some reason you're not answering your damn phone?

Ambien.

What happened here, Dexter?

I couldn't find the remote.

Where's your sister?

She didn't come back to work, and she's not at her apartment.

I honestly don't know, sergeant.

Dexter...

We think her boyfriend Rudy's connected to the ice-truck k*ller.

We're working on getting a search warrant right now to search his home.

No. Wow...

Cut the crap.

You know something. What?

James!

I saw him last night, skulking in the lab, ordering secret blood tests.

What kind of tests?

I was looking for a type match on the blood on Batista's collar.

And whose was it?

Rudy's.

m*therf*cker.

Knock it off!

He knew all along!

Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.

Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

It was just a wild hunch.

Why didn't you tell us?

I couldn't destroy Deb's love life on a hunch.

I had to get the facts.

Here are the facts: if he kills her, it's your fault. Now, what else do you know?

That's it.

He's lying.

Give him a break, James. It's his sister, all right?

Well, if he knows what's good for her, he'll sit his a*s at home and answer the f*cking phone when it rings.

Call if you hear anything.

Hello?

Please don't hang up.

Paul?

The kids don't want to talk to you, all right?

You got to give them more time.

This isn't about them.

It's about how I was arrested.

Yeah, with a needle in your arm -- I know all about it.

Well, I don't.

Listen, I take responsibility for all the sh*t I pulled, but, Rita, I was in the program.

I kicked the hard stuff.

Well, apparently not.

I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.

It's been driving me nuts how I got -- from your house one minute to the motel room the next, completely out of my mind on junk.

Yeah, it's called a blackout, Paul.

It's called a setup.

Well done.

The last thing I remember was standing in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

Now, he could have smacked me over the head and dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.

You really are a piece of work.

I'm telling you --

Dexter is not who you think he is.

Hello?

This one, I've got to make sure we got about seven copies of these.

I want to make sure it's distributed to everyone, okay?

Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.

Some of you may have met him.

He was dating officer Morgan.

Now, she was last seen 16 hours ago, driving to meet him at the Miami Beach marina.

So we need to canvass the entire area.

Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

I've already sent a team over to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

The judge just signed off on the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

Well, let's tear that place apart.

Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

Your attention, please.

I want to introduce you to our new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.

She agreed to put her vacation on hold, come in early, to provide us with some much-needed leadership at this critical time.

Lieutenant, you're on.

I understand we have a new suspect in the ice-truck k*ller case.

We're on our way over now to search his place.

And you are...

Maria Laguerta.

And we have an officer missing, so we need to move fast.

I thought that sergeant Doakes was running that investigation.

He's out following a lead.

What lead?

He said he'd let me know if it came to anything. Now if you excuse me --

I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

Who here can get me up to speed on the way over?

I can, I guess.

You're driving.

And feel free to join us when you locate your partner.

Would you like to come with us, captain?

You seem to have everything under control.

Let's go, people.

It's in there somewhere --

My birthplace.

Now what?

No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

With billions spent on Homeland Security, it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

So much for the w*r on terror.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

I don't like this place.

Something nameless was born here...

Something that lives in the deepest, darkest hole of the thing called "Dexter."

Get in there!

Somebody else -- Get in there now!

It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

Nothing will hurt you -- I promise.

Okay, Deb... don't be dead.

sh*t.

Surprise, m*therf*cker.

Are you following me now?

You better have a hell of a reason for being here.

I'm looking for my sister.

In a cargo box?

Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.

You forget you work for the f*cking cops?

We love theories. Spin me a story, as*h*le.

What I do on my time is my business, sergeant.

Yeah, me too, and I'm on my time now.

There's no lieutenant here to save your a*s, so don't f*ck with me, Morgan!

All right, you got me.

I ordered some furniture from Thailand.

I was waiting for it to be delivered.

Lab geek -- My a*s.

Hey, what the hell's going on over here?!

Security, I need to get somebody down here right now.

Miami metro P.D.

Yeah Is this guy under arrest?

That's a good question.

You're connected to this.

I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your a*s.

Let me out of here, m*therf*cker!

Let me out of here!

Let me out! Let me out! Let me out, you piece of sh*t!

Let me out of here, you f*cking piece -- Aah!

f*ck! Let me out!

Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio, and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

Bye!

His happy place, where he kills more than time --

This is where he'd leave me a clue.

Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.

I like the cold.

You know, hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.

Yeah, and so can hypochondria.

And a home setup like this would take years to put together.

He must have hated leaving it behind.

What are you looking for?

A clue, signature or calling card --

Anything that might give us a sense of where he went.

Well, I don't think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this.

I mean, look at this place.

Hey, you were right about the victim at Santa's cottage.

He rushed his work.

He k*lled that girl to keep us busy so he could escape, but he wouldn't go without leaving us a message.

We just need to find it.

Check this out.

This is where he played with his meat.

Pretty whacked out, huh?

I can think of 101

uses for this table.

Know what I mean?

He has my sister, Vince.

Right.

I mean -- I didn't mean -- I'm sorry.

sh*t.

You're Karen, right?

That's right.

You're in charge of evidence -- this entire room -- evidence.

Take photos of every item in its original position: work-kit, packages...

Show me the inventory list when you're done.

Is he in charge?

Guess he is now.

Rita?

Rita?

Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

Can I help you?

I guess Paul never mentioned me.

I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

Right.

So, having your sponsor do your dirty work --

Which step is that?

See, he's -- he's just concerned for the kids.

No, he's concerned for himself. If you'll excuse me...

I thought he was lying, too, until I saw the proof.

What proof?

Well, the X-rays the prison doctor took of Paul's head --

They showed a skull fracture.

Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

No. You didn't.

See, after you struck him, the hospital took X-rays -- No fracture.

But in prison, a fracture.

If you know Paul, you'd know he'd bash his own head against the wall to get what he wants.

Well, I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.

No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!

The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

♪ Ring around the rosie ♪

♪ A pocket full of posies ♪

♪ Ashes, ashes ♪

♪ We all fall down! ♪

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.

His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.

Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".

Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.

Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.

Previously on "Dexter"...

What happened changed something inside you, Dex.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

What can I do to help?

No blood. What a beautiful idea.

Refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "hey, want to play?"

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.

We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.

Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.

Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.

As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?

Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.

However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood. What a gorgeous idea.

Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold environment... to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man. You did... when you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam. You in?

Hey, man. Sounds good.

I thought you said you wanted to go get sh*t-faced.

I am sh*t-faced.

I showed my face to Guerrero, to his whole church.

They're gonna think I'm behind this sh*t.

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

He's escalating the thrill, posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show us what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Fingertips.

f*ckin' as*h*le, that's my girl.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

I find people around me are always making some kind of connection, like friendship or romance, but human bonds always lead to messy complications... commitment, sharing, driving people to the airport.

Besides, if I let someone get that close,

So, time to put on my mask.

I need your expertise.

I live to serve.

Excuse us, fellas.

Interesting hand job.

That's funny.

It is?

So, how long you think it's been there?

This feels familiar.

Okay. So, how long has it been there?

Blood stopped pooling, still wet... couple hours at the most.

What time was it found?

A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.

No prints. Wiped clean. Real creep show, huh?

Any sign of the rest of the body?

Just Mr. Hand. Do you think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

It's hard to say. There's blood. That's different.

Plus, it's a male victim-- haven't seen that before.

The cut appears to be almost delicate.

You see between the first and second row of carpals...

Very surgical.

Check out what else he left behind.

A little postcard to remember him by.

How far is Rand Beach from here?

This is Rand Beach.

It was renamed Petrie Beach a few years ago.

Okay, everybody.

Everybody say "stinky feet".

Stinky feet!

Wait. Nobody move. Dexter, were you smiling?

No.

Okay, we'll do another one.

This time, everybody smiles. You, too, Dex.

Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.

Shut your damn face, Deb.

Hey, language, please.

What? She always talks like that.

Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.

What's your problem?

I hate the beach.

It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.

Too bad. You're part of a family.

And being part of a family means smiling for photos.

Why should I pretend I'm happy?

Because it'll make your mom happy, and because it's how you fit in.

Remember we talked about that?

Yeah.

This is how you do it.

When somebody takes your picture, you smile.

It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

You just do it to fit in. Okay?

Okay.

All right.

Come here, handsome.

Okay. Everybody ready? One more time.

Stinky feet!

Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.

Straight to the station after, yeah. Thanks, lieutenant.

Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...

Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.

Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...

Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.

Previously on "Dexter"...

Think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

It's the guard-- Tucci.

I think he's alive.

Tucci's alive?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

He's sending me a message.

He wants me to go there.

Please.

He was left here so I would k*ll him.

Just k*ll me.

I can't k*ll this man.

Taking Tucci over to County alive.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

The thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be. I'm Dexter.

I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone, maybe post-apocalypse or plague, Whatever-- No one left to act normal for, no need to hide who I really am.

It would be

...freeing.

Stop grinning like a f*cking psycho and get back to work.

Sorry, sergeant.

I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before I tear the bed apart.

I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

My shadow companion chose this place well.

This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.

All these people pawing over it seems...

He was here for days, playing with sharp objects.

I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless, amazingly so.

The only blood I found belongs to the security guard.

Has he said anything yet?

Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

Lieutenant, up here!

There's got to be something here. Find it.

The guy's not a ghost. Tony Tucci is evidence of that.

Hey, Dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet?

It's like sh**ting a Jackson Pollock.

Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.

Ready?

Okay.

What was that?

Did you see that?

What?

Damn rats.

We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their sh*t in the dust.

We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.

Lovely. Can we get the lights, guys?

You ever heard of rat-bite fever?

Masuka, what'd I say about the f*cking rats?

You haven't found anything, won't find anything.

This is a bust, right?

In so many words.

Which means I'm just jerking off till Tucci wakes up.

So take a break. You've been working this thing 24-7.

Or are you still avoiding a personal life?

Oh, f*ck you.

And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.

Thanks, guys.

It doesn't have to be either/or.

Maybe not for you.

If I found someone, so can you, right?

Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

Tell me about it.

Yelina? Are you okay?

I'm sorry. I'm fine.

Ernesto hasn't arrived?

I'm sure he'll be here soon.

No.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Coyote?

You mean the man you paid to bring him here?

He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.

But that was a week ago, and no one in Cárdenas has heard from Ernesto.

Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

...This was his number, but it's not working anymore.

I was supposed to leave him money in a park.

Listen, my boyfriend works for the police. I'm sure he--

No, no, no. We can't go to the police.

He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba.

No, it's okay. It's okay. Dexter will know what to do.

I feel just terrible for her.

And they were supposed to be married after he got here.

I do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues.

I can talk to him.

That's really kind of you, Dex.

I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your fiancée is dead or alive?

Uh, no.

Every night after work Yelina goes across the street, to the beach.

I've seen her there, just... staring out at the water, willing him to walk out of it.

Have you ever longed for anything like that?

She wants something from me. Ever since the blow job, she assumes we've taken it to the next level.

She doesn't know yet-- I don't have a next level.

Well, when I was a kid, I would have k*lled for an Atari.

You know?

Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man...

It always comes to this once sex is introduced.

Small talk no longer cuts it.

Eventually she'll call me a science project and slam the door in my face.

But when do you think he'll wake up?

Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a k*ller out there that's into whores and security guards, but I'll bet nurses are next.

Yo, check you, all "MPD Blue".

Shanda, what are you doing here?

You have another lead on the ice-truck k*ller?

Man, I got bigger worries than that sick sh*t.

Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?

I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what you're after.

Oh, hell, no.

But my landlord's another f*cking story--

Trying to kick me out of my home.

Shanda.

He got no cause, except he's a born-again hypocrite m*therf*cker.

Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?

No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.

Morgan. Found this in evidence.

Masuka was gonna grease it through.

A cigarette butt?

Jesus, we could pull DNA off of that, or even a print.

Except it would be your print.

You were smoking on a crime scene.

Not on the crime scene-- like on the way-far end of the park.

The whole area's a crime scene. You should know that by now.

Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.

Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.

Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.

Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.

I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.

Previously on "Dexter"...

Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.

Hey, Angel, I got him!

They really found the ice-truck k*ller?

I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.

Son of a b*tch.

I have so many questions for him.

What was his message to me?

Now I need to know him.

Hi.

The f*ck are you?

Paul Bennett. Father on parole.

Dexter Morgan.

I can't think of anything clever to say.

Divorce papers -- Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I'd better make the most of them.

Your instincts were dead-on.

They're always dead-on when it comes to K*llers. Why is that?

I'm watchin' you.

What are we looking at here?

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

You?

No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?

Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you?

I like seafood.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

Not as hard as her.

Damn power outages.

I don't know, Angel.

Most firearm suicides are committed by men.

Women tend to slash their wrists, take pills, something more ladylike.

Not in Miami.

We closed a couple of su1c1de cases just like this last year, remember?

Look at this mess.

That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?

House husband. And aspiring artist.

Promising.

So, she supported him?

It looks like that.

She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

Those other suicides we closed -- those were high-powered women too, right?

I don't know. I think so.

Note to self.

I don't care what it looks like. Somebody k*lled her.

We're checking out all the possibilities, Mr. Gayle.

Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem?

You know, job stress, the usual, but she was working through it in therapy.

She have any other problems that you're aware of? Threats?

Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.

I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.

You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.

Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?

To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.

You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪

♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪

♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪

♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.

Previously on "Dexter"...

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No, he's got unfinished business with me. "Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."

Paul called after you left.

He's already out of jail -- Overcrowding.

Can you believe it?

Are you f*cking my wife?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

I just wish he'd go away.

Why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you to.

It's different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love. "Barbie, be patient. "One day we'll share a cold one."

Thank god for showers. Private time to think --

Harder to come by now that I'm in a real relationship.

Do you mind?

Not at all.

Could you pass the soap?

Yeah.

It's locked!

Mom, I got to pee!

I'll be right there, sweetie!

Hold on a second, buddy!

I can't!

Sorry. One-bathroom house.

Nature calls.

Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?

Cody!

Sword fight -- I won.

Mom, I got to brush.

Whatever happened to knocking?

I'm gonna be late for school.

You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna...

I mean, what does "separation" mean to you?

What "separation" means to me is that you're separated, and you work it out. Now, this was false pretenses.

I mean, I knew she wanted a divorce when she asked for the separation -- she lied.

Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.

I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...

And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.

Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.

If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.

Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.

Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.

Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.

Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.

But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.

I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.Previously on "Dexter"...

You still don't remember anything from before?

You know, before we took you in?

No.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

Mama!

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad.

And this is Rudy.

Dexter.

Hey.

I have waited a long time to meet you.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell's this guy thinking?

And the real king is still out there.

Hungry. Ready.

He'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think --

I'm falling for him.

Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

No!

f*cking whore!

Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday.

Can't be late Monday. Throws the whole week off.

What about breakfast?

Made and eaten.

And the kids' lunches?

Packed and ready to go.

Did you tell the locksmith?

Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven-pin keyways.

I want to talk to your mom for a sec.

Are you gonna make out?

None of your business.

Are you?

Astor.

Rita, you don't have to do this, you know.

Getting att*cked by your ex-husband merits a day off.

I'm fine.

I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore.

Those days are over.

It's gonna be okay. The police have been notified.

They'll find him.

What if they don't?

I got you some pepper spray.

Just aim for the eyes.

Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

I had some at Kirk's birthday,

10 days ago.

See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here.

Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think.

It started out vanilla.

Guys, you should look at this.

Put that thing down, for God's sake.

It was addressed to Homicide.

Put it down!

Jesus, is that blood?

Morgan, get your a*s over here.

a*s en route.

You're the blood expert. What is this sh*t?

It's a little watery for jam.

Maybe you should open it.

What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released?

I got to wash my hands.

So gullible.

What is it?

Well, it's definitely blood.

Wait, there's something in here.

Marina View hotel.

It's a key.

May be some sort of promotional gag.

You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood.

Show-and-tell's over.

Let's try and find out who sent this.

Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.

Batista's still working on the expl*si*n at the smack lab.

Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.

A jar of blood --

Dramatic, cryptic, playful.

Could it be him?

Got an extra key from the manager.

Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.

The guy who checked into 103

was white and normal looking.

I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here.

It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security.

Better be ready to cancel your lunch.

Police. Open up.

Oh, my God. Jesus. Get back in your room.

Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8

out at the Marina View hotel.

I need uniformed backup, forensics.

f*ck it. Just send everybody out.

It's been a while since we went prophylactic.

Not me. Last night, I met this chick --

I'll stop you right there, Vince.

So, they tell you anything about what's inside?

No one's been inside. Too much blood.

Dexter.

Just a heads-up -- It's bad in there.

Okay.

I'm serious.

Okay.

She's not kidding. It's your wet dream in there.

Okay.

You're going in first alone.

Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report. Don't f*ck up.

Now I'm really curious.

He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me?

Mommy!

Tell me you found something, Morgan.

I talked to the guests in room 105.

They didn't see anyone go in or out.

What about across the hall?

German tourists. They got their head up their lederhosen.

They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming.

Oh, my god!

Hey. Hey, you okay?

I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there.

Never should have skipped breakfast.

Bullshit. You're shaking. What the hell happened up there?

No, I'm okay. I just need a little air.

Something finally got to you.

I guess you're human after all.

Cut him some slack, all right?

I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar.

Tell us what you saw, Dex.

How many dead?

A lot.

But no bodies, just blood --

50, 60 liters.

Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know.

You're saying there was a mass m*rder in there, but they took the bodies?

How is that possible?

There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms.

Someone would have seen corpses coming out.

I don't f*cking know.

Hey, Dexter, you all right?

I can't go back in there.

You don't have to.

Fine.

Just get yourself cleaned up and --

I don't know -- Work from the hallway or something.

You're in room 422.

Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags.

Dade county sheriff's department.

I'm looking for Rita Bennett.

That's me. Did you find Paul?

I'm sorry?

Paul Bennett.

My ex-husband att*cked me last night.

My boyfriend filed a police report.

The only report we have is the one that Mr. Bennett filed.

What? Wait.

Paul filed a police report? For what?

as*ault. Your ex-husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital.

He's pressing charges against you.

He att*cked me!

Not according to him.

All right. Can we talk about this later?

We need a formal statement.

You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station.

Fine.

Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from. All right?

Sweet.

You should really get in here, Dex.

I never seen anything like this.

Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts.

Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue. Come see.

Photos, Vince.

Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting?

The blood's not clotting?

No.

Genuine medical mystery.

Just keep getting samples.

I'll test it at the lab.

Hello? Don't hang up.

Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station.

Paul's pressing as*ault charges against me.

How's it even possible? I was defending myself.

Just stay calm. I know a lawyer.

I'll straighten it out.

I am calm.

They're the hysterical ones.

They're charging me with a class-2 felony.

Hello, Dexter? Are you there?

Yeah, I'm right here.

This is ridiculous.

I could lose my job. I could lose my kids.

I won't let that happen.

Well, I'm glad you're so confident.

Rita, just trust me.

I know how the system works.

Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.

You okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Thank you.

Yeah, bye.

Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out.

What? A wall socket?

Yeah.

Of course there's a wall socket. There's lots of wall --

Hey, you're right.

There was something plugged in here -- probably a power tool to cut them up.

Come take a look.

Photos, Vince.

Lots and lots of photos.

Open Sesame.

Blood samples for the fridge.

And you better make room. There's a lot more coming.

sh**t at the Bel Canto tonight. You in?

I'm not in the mood.

Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central.

Look at this.

They were for Nina's birthday -- backstage passes to Neil Diamond.

You're in worse shape than I thought.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

Oh, Masuka was looking for you.

Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.

Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection.

A bit of an overshare.

You want to talk about what happened today?

Already did.

Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died.

Can talk to me, you know?

Just got to open your mouth and move it.

I'll call Rudy. I'll tell him I'll be late.

Deb, seriously.

I puked.

I'm fine.

I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do.

Why do you always do this?

Do what?

You shut me out!

Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you.

I still don't know how that makes you feel.

I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call.

Fine.

Whatever.

Did Paul force his way into the house?

No.

Did you ask him to leave?

Yes, and he refused.

But in your statement, it says you invited your ex-husband into your bedroom.

He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading --

Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

And you didn't want it to escalate. I understand that, but we can't prove intent.

Your ex-husband has the injuries here, not you.

Paul has a record of spousal abuse.

Spousal abuse can be mutual.

It was never mutual.

Okay.

But the man is a model parolee.

His drug tests are clean.

He's got glowing reports from the court-appointed supervisor.

Corrections will want to see this guy transition.

I don't care!

He's not going near my children. Do you understand?

Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children.

Now, you have deposition in two days.

Do not give this man any more amm*nit*on than he already has.

Okay.

Damn.

Just blood?

What happened to the bodies?

Hell if I know.

I don't want to know.

Blood was bad enough.

No wonder you seem so amped.

Your brother must have loved it.

f*ck no. He freaked.

Really?

I thought, you know, blood was his thing.

What happened?

I don' know. It was like usual. He shut me out.

Did he say anything?

Let's not talk about Dex right now.

Was it like a panic attack?

I don't know.

He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.

Kiss me.

What's the matter? You don't even have wood.

Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk.

Yeah, but not now. I'm horny.

Maybe I should call him.

Are you f*cking kidding me?

What? We -- We bonded last weekend.

Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family?

Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants.

Deb, that's not fair.

You take me out on a -- couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn?

I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.

You know what?

Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.

Okay. I'm gonna go watch  TV.

She loved him so g*dd*mn much.

She took every one of his CDs in the separation.

She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits.

Nina loved Neil Diamond. "Song Sung Blue." "September Morn."

Oh, my god -- "Kentucky Woman."

You got to love that sh*t.

That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.

Waitress! Is there a waitress?

I need a drink. Waitress!

Bro, you're a train wreck.

Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce.

I ain't ashamed.

Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.

Look...

Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask.

Comprendo?

Eighty-six the ring.

I have to take a squirt.

She's gonna f*ck me silly.

My sister's right. I don't share my problems with her...

Or with anybody.

Harry taught me that -- Secrecy, self-reliance, and a well-stocked cupboard of hefty bags.

Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage...

Until that boy in the blood.

He scares me. I want him to go away.

You awake?

What?

Are you sure you locked the door?

Yeah, I'm positive -- Bolt and chain.

What am I gonna do?

Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

And I will.

I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own.

Fortunately, Rita's has a name.

Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103

left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.

One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.

Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.

You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.

So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.

I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --

Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.

Previously on "Dexter"...

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

It's Paul. He...

He violated Florida's three-strikes law.

The cops picked him up totally strung out on heroin.

He's back in jail.

Holy sh*t! They're f*cking fingertips.

He started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

Menthol?

Like cough drops.

I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he...

Son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

I was confused because I love you.

What did you say?

I love you.

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

No, it's -- I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.

I need an ambulance at

1228 Calendar Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.

The same images running through my head over and over.

I was there.

I saw my mother's death.

A buried memory, forgotten all these years.

It climbed inside me that day.

And it's been with me ever since --

My dark passenger.

You should be focusing on me, socio.

Seriously want to get the m*therf*cker that did this to Batista.

I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.

How's he doing? Do we know?

Still in surgery.

Laguerta's there.

God, I hate feeling so helpless.

What, no jokes about providing gross sexual comfort in a time of crisis?

Our friend was stabbed...

And he might die.

Officer Morgan.

What do you think, Dex?

He put up a fight. There was a struggle.

Attaboy, Angel.

Here, this trail --

Steady stream of drops.

He had a few seconds. Tried to move away until -- till he fell.

So much blood.

What's happening to me?

No way.

You're the one I'm supposed to meet.

In the flesh.

You know, I was just talking to someone about you.

That tickles.

Don't stop.

I wouldn't dream of stopping.

You're so different this time --

Gentle.

Are you gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again?

Actually, your...

...imperfection is what saved you the first time.

Saved me from what?

True artistry.

The message of my work is -- not in the product itself, but rather the presentation.

That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.

It's quite unsightly, actually.

Hey, you don't have to be an as*h*le about it.

Hey, hey, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to offend.

Truthfully...

I'm thankful for you.

You're my escape plan.

Escape from what?

The police.

Because of you, I've had to speed up my... project.

I need something to distract them by.

And I always found a freshly chopped-up body always does the trick.

Wait, wait! No!

Don't struggle.

That never helps.

I'm compressing your carotid artery, and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.

In about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.

Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.

Okay, I guess you went to bed.

Or you fell asleep on the couch watching "Xena" reruns, which I still think makes you a dork.

Either way, call me when you get this, okay?

Miss you.

He's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.

So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.

No. I mean, I can't.

Alright. I understand.

You need to be there for your friend.

I haven't told the kids yet.

Told them about Angel?

No, about Paul...

Being back in prison?

I hate breaking their hearts. They think so much of their dad now.

Right.

You know what?

Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.

Thanks.

They're actually coming out right now. I got to go.

Angel sustained severe internal injuries.

He lost a lot of blood.

But... the surgery was successful.

It looks like our boy's out of the woods.

I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.

But I can't focus.

I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

I need to know what it means.

Morgan.

What the f*ck is wrong with you?

I have someplace I have to be.

Well, we all got someplace to be.

But you just found out that somebody who was supposed to be your friend is gonna live.

Does that make you feel anything?

Anything at all?

Take your f*cking hand off me.

Just what I always thought.

Right.

♪ Deck the halls with parts of bodies ♪

♪ La-da-da-da dum ♪

sh*t. Just what I need.

Hey.

I know it's late.

I guess you didn't get my message.

I drove by and saw your car.

I can go.

Get your a*s in here.

It's about time you see where I live anyway.

You have no idea how much I needed this.

You feel good.

And cold. You're freezing!

Well, then stay and keep me warm.

This Batista thing has gotten to you, hasn't it?

Angel's daughter was there.

That's got to be rough.

Daughter of a cop --

Just like you.

Yeah.

I remember what that's like --

Kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.

Let's get out of town for the weekend --

Just the two of us.

We need to talk.

I'm sitting right here.

Nope.

The time has got to be right.

Okay.

It'll have to wait...

At least till we catch the as*h*le who did this to Batista.

Let me warn you -- I can be very persistent.

I need to get out of town, and I need you... to come... with me.

What I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.

I'm totally wired from all this sh*t.

Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.

My loving arms.

And...

I got a little thing to help you sleep.

That ain't no little thing.

I meant Valium.

It's one of the perks working at the hospital.

Wine and Valium?

I'll be totally helpless.

You read my mind.

Well, as I live and breathe!

You miss me?

You and the bear claws you're hiding behind your back.

This must be important.

Haven't seen much of you lately.

No rest for the wicked.

How's Gene?

Good days and bad.

He just finished his first round of radiation.

Well, he's a good guy.

Not much of a bridge player, though.

Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and I would take them to the cleaners.

I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.

Well, sure thing.

Got a date?

Not exactly.

It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

I wish I could help, but... everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basement at City Hall.

And... as you can see, I'm up to my you-know-what in year-end reports, so...

It's my lieutenant.

Camilla, is there anything you remember?

What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his home and give you a loving family.

I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.

Who found the body parts?

I did.

They were left under the tree.

I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around...

Till I found the head.

I told him not to touch anything, but he never listens.

God, Patty, you're such a b*tch.

Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary before you found the body?

There were some broken ornaments by the tree.

Who could do something like this so close to Christmas?

The Grinch.

Oh, you're a f*cking riot, Max!

Like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this.

There go our jobs.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Oh, sucks to be an elf.

...Get some visual surveillance.

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim. Cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

Yep. And after the bloodbath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the press on this one.

James!

Yeah?

I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.

And will somebody turn off this g*dd*mn snow machine?!

Your sister can help you out.

That a whole sexual-tension thing or am I missing something?

103.

It's the same numbers he left at Marina View hotel.

Any leads as to what they mean?

We've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers

-- Nothing.

They need more to go on.

First he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.

Now he leaves me this --

A calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.

It doesn't make sense.

Crime scene's wiped clean.

Another hooker?

Ho, ho, ho -- Another dead ho.

Somebody's been naughty.

Hey, Morgan.

Want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for Christmas?

And he's back!

No, thanks.

Last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.

This doesn't seem right.

Body parts scattered among the presents.

Broken ornaments.

It's not his usual meticulous style.

It seems rushed...

Haphazard.

That would explain why we can't find one of the hands.

What's wrong?

There's something underneath the torso.

Merry Christmas, Miami.

After all this time, why do you think the ice-truck k*ller has struck again?

Any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.

Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?

None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?

After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.

Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.

Previously on "Dexter"...

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim, cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Dexter...

Laura Moser...

My mother.

Laura Moser and 3 others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

Angel was stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place.

You really don't want to do this.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

Yes, yes, yes.

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Where the f*ck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.

I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

I've lived in darkness a long time.

Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I don't have much time -- or, to be more accurate, my sister doesn't have much time.

He wants me to find him, but where do I look?

I can't think.

It's too bright.

Let me know if the tape's too tight.

You know, there's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

Why are you doing this?

Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.

Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Shh, I'm just checking the supplies, okay?

Things are moving a little faster than I had planned.

This isn't you.

Pretty sure it is.

No!

I know there's more -- I've seen it.

I never wanted to hurt you.

I know. I know.

Does this make it easier for you? Because I can keep going.

Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!

There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb. I mean, you're not the only one who bought it, okay?

Your name isn't even f*cking Rudy Cooper, is it?

Nope...

But he died for a good cause.

Yeah, so will you.

You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

Not some invisible hooker -- you kidnapped a cop!

It's all part of the plan.

Oh, Jesus.

It's hard to believe it's almost come to fruition.

I mean, this is a lot of years in the making.

We're only hours away.

He wouldn't have taken Deb unless he left me everything a clever monster would need in order to find them.

♪ Born free, ♪

♪ As free as the wind blows ♪

♪ As free as the grass grows ♪

♪ Born free to follow your heart ♪

Seems I have a new screen saver.

I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded, but "Born free"?

Of course.

Thanks to Rudy, now I know where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

Born free of all that's human --

That's where I'll find him.

She knows.

She knows.

All f*cking night with that.

She knows.

Listen, Angel, we need your help.

Masuka says you were following up a lead on the ice-truck k*ller when you were att*cked.

A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

John painted her nails different colors, but it didn't go nowhere.

Except she was just cut up by the ice-truck k*ller.

Holy sh*t. Monique was a victim?

Now, we're operating on the theory that he found out you were on his trail.

And if we're right, that means you got stabbed for a reason. It wasn't no carjacking.

How did he know it was me?

No one knew what I was doing except Masuka.

Someone else had to know. Think.

I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.

But that's crazy, right?

No, she's been AWOL since going out last night to meet him.

She was supposed to come back and help me canvass, but she never made it.

That's not like her.

Angel, we got to go.

Go, just go.

There are roughly 5,000 cargo containers in the port of Miami.

Finding the one where my mother was butchered took a bit of magic.

Busted.

Busted.

sh*t.

Just a second!

I told you he was here.

There some reason you're not answering your damn phone?

Ambien.

What happened here, Dexter?

I couldn't find the remote.

Where's your sister?

She didn't come back to work, and she's not at her apartment.

I honestly don't know, sergeant.

Dexter...

We think her boyfriend Rudy's connected to the ice-truck k*ller.

We're working on getting a search warrant right now to search his home.

No. Wow...

Cut the crap.

You know something. What?

James!

I saw him last night, skulking in the lab, ordering secret blood tests.

What kind of tests?

I was looking for a type match on the blood on Batista's collar.

And whose was it?

Rudy's.

m*therf*cker.

Knock it off!

He knew all along!

Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.

Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

It was just a wild hunch.

Why didn't you tell us?

I couldn't destroy Deb's love life on a hunch.

I had to get the facts.

Here are the facts: if he kills her, it's your fault. Now, what else do you know?

That's it.

He's lying.

Give him a break, James. It's his sister, all right?

Well, if he knows what's good for her, he'll sit his a*s at home and answer the f*cking phone when it rings.

Call if you hear anything.

Hello?

Please don't hang up.

Paul?

The kids don't want to talk to you, all right?

You got to give them more time.

This isn't about them.

It's about how I was arrested.

Yeah, with a needle in your arm -- I know all about it.

Well, I don't.

Listen, I take responsibility for all the sh*t I pulled, but, Rita, I was in the program.

I kicked the hard stuff.

Well, apparently not.

I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.

It's been driving me nuts how I got -- from your house one minute to the motel room the next, completely out of my mind on junk.

Yeah, it's called a blackout, Paul.

It's called a setup.

Well done.

The last thing I remember was standing in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

Now, he could have smacked me over the head and dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.

You really are a piece of work.

I'm telling you --

Dexter is not who you think he is.

Hello?

This one, I've got to make sure we got about seven copies of these.

I want to make sure it's distributed to everyone, okay?

Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.

Some of you may have met him.

He was dating officer Morgan.

Now, she was last seen 16 hours ago, driving to meet him at the Miami Beach marina.

So we need to canvass the entire area.

Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

I've already sent a team over to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

The judge just signed off on the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

Well, let's tear that place apart.

Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

Your attention, please.

I want to introduce you to our new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.

She agreed to put her vacation on hold, come in early, to provide us with some much-needed leadership at this critical time.

Lieutenant, you're on.

I understand we have a new suspect in the ice-truck k*ller case.

We're on our way over now to search his place.

And you are...

Maria Laguerta.

And we have an officer missing, so we need to move fast.

I thought that sergeant Doakes was running that investigation.

He's out following a lead.

What lead?

He said he'd let me know if it came to anything. Now if you excuse me --

I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

Who here can get me up to speed on the way over?

I can, I guess.

You're driving.

And feel free to join us when you locate your partner.

Would you like to come with us, captain?

You seem to have everything under control.

Let's go, people.

It's in there somewhere --

My birthplace.

Now what?

No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

With billions spent on Homeland Security, it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

So much for the w*r on terror.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

I don't like this place.

Something nameless was born here...

Something that lives in the deepest, darkest hole of the thing called "Dexter."

Get in there!

Somebody else -- Get in there now!

It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

Nothing will hurt you -- I promise.

Okay, Deb... don't be dead.

sh*t.

Surprise, m*therf*cker.

Are you following me now?

You better have a hell of a reason for being here.

I'm looking for my sister.

In a cargo box?

Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.

You forget you work for the f*cking cops?

We love theories. Spin me a story, as*h*le.

What I do on my time is my business, sergeant.

Yeah, me too, and I'm on my time now.

There's no lieutenant here to save your a*s, so don't f*ck with me, Morgan!

All right, you got me.

I ordered some furniture from Thailand.

I was waiting for it to be delivered.

Lab geek -- My a*s.

Hey, what the hell's going on over here?!

Security, I need to get somebody down here right now.

Miami metro P.D.

Yeah Is this guy under arrest?

That's a good question.

You're connected to this.

I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your a*s.

Let me out of here, m*therf*cker!

Let me out of here!

Let me out! Let me out! Let me out, you piece of sh*t!

Let me out of here, you f*cking piece -- Aah!

f*ck! Let me out!

Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio, and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

Bye!

His happy place, where he kills more than time --

This is where he'd leave me a clue.

Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.

I like the cold.

You know, hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.

Yeah, and so can hypochondria.

And a home setup like this would take years to put together.

He must have hated leaving it behind.

What are you looking for?

A clue, signature or calling card --

Anything that might give us a sense of where he went.

Well, I don't think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this.

I mean, look at this place.

Hey, you were right about the victim at Santa's cottage.

He rushed his work.

He k*lled that girl to keep us busy so he could escape, but he wouldn't go without leaving us a message.

We just need to find it.

Check this out.

This is where he played with his meat.

Pretty whacked out, huh?

I can think of 101

uses for this table.

Know what I mean?

He has my sister, Vince.

Right.

I mean -- I didn't mean -- I'm sorry.

sh*t.

You're Karen, right?

That's right.

You're in charge of evidence -- this entire room -- evidence.

Take photos of every item in its original position: work-kit, packages...

Show me the inventory list when you're done.

Is he in charge?

Guess he is now.

Rita?

Rita?

Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

Can I help you?

I guess Paul never mentioned me.

I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

Right.

So, having your sponsor do your dirty work --

Which step is that?

See, he's -- he's just concerned for the kids.

No, he's concerned for himself. If you'll excuse me...

I thought he was lying, too, until I saw the proof.

What proof?

Well, the X-rays the prison doctor took of Paul's head --

They showed a skull fracture.

Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

No. You didn't.

See, after you struck him, the hospital took X-rays -- No fracture.

But in prison, a fracture.

If you know Paul, you'd know he'd bash his own head against the wall to get what he wants.

Well, I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.

No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!

The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.

His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

♪ ven conmigo... ♪

♪ junto a mi corazón ♪

♪ y me quite la vida♪

♪si no tengo tu amor ♪

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.

Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".

Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.

Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.Previously on "Dexter"...

What happened changed something inside you, Dex.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

What can I do to help?

No blood. What a beautiful idea.

Refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "hey, want to play?"

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.

We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.

Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.

Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.

As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?

Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.

However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood. What a gorgeous idea.

Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold environment... to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man. You did... when you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam. You in?

Hey, man. Sounds good.

I thought you said you wanted to go get sh*t-faced.

I am sh*t-faced.

I showed my face to Guerrero, to his whole church.

They're gonna think I'm behind this sh*t.

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

He's escalating the thrill, posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show us what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Fingertips.

f*ckin' as*h*le, that's my girl.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

I find people around me are always making some kind of connection, like friendship or romance, but human bonds always lead to messy complications... commitment, sharing, driving people to the airport.

Besides, if I let someone get that close,

So, time to put on my mask.

I need your expertise.

I live to serve.

Excuse us, fellas.

Interesting hand job.

That's funny.

It is?

So, how long you think it's been there?

This feels familiar.

Okay. So, how long has it been there?

Blood stopped pooling, still wet... couple hours at the most.

What time was it found?

A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.

No prints. Wiped clean. Real creep show, huh?

Any sign of the rest of the body?

Just Mr. Hand. Do you think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

It's hard to say. There's blood. That's different.

Plus, it's a male victim-- haven't seen that before.

The cut appears to be almost delicate.

You see between the first and second row of carpals...

Very surgical.

Check out what else he left behind.

A little postcard to remember him by.

How far is Rand Beach from here?

This is Rand Beach.

It was renamed Petrie Beach a few years ago.

Okay, everybody.

Everybody say "stinky feet".

Stinky feet!

Wait. Nobody move. Dexter, were you smiling?

No.

Okay, we'll do another one.

This time, everybody smiles. You, too, Dex.

Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.

Shut your damn face, Deb.

Hey, language, please.

What? She always talks like that.

Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.

What's your problem?

I hate the beach.

It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.

Too bad. You're part of a family.

And being part of a family means smiling for photos.

Why should I pretend I'm happy?

Because it'll make your mom happy, and because it's how you fit in.

Remember we talked about that?

Yeah.

This is how you do it.

When somebody takes your picture, you smile.

It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

You just do it to fit in. Okay?

Okay.

All right.

Come here, handsome.

Okay. Everybody ready? One more time.

Stinky feet!

Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.

Straight to the station after, yeah. Thanks, lieutenant.

Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...

Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.

Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...

Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.Previously on "Dexter"...

Think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

It's the guard-- Tucci.

I think he's alive.

Tucci's alive?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

He's sending me a message.

He wants me to go there.

Please.

He was left here so I would k*ll him.

Just k*ll me.

I can't k*ll this man.

Taking Tucci over to County alive.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

The thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be. I'm Dexter.

I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone, maybe post-apocalypse or plague, Whatever-- No one left to act normal for, no need to hide who I really am.

It would be

...freeing.

Stop grinning like a f*cking psycho and get back to work.

Sorry, sergeant.

I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before I tear the bed apart.

I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

My shadow companion chose this place well.

This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.

All these people pawing over it seems...

He was here for days, playing with sharp objects.

I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless, amazingly so.

The only blood I found belongs to the security guard.

Has he said anything yet?

Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

Lieutenant, up here!

There's got to be something here. Find it.

The guy's not a ghost. Tony Tucci is evidence of that.

Hey, Dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet?

It's like sh**ting a Jackson Pollock.

Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.

Ready?

Okay.

What was that?

Did you see that?

What?

Damn rats.

We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their sh*t in the dust.

We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.

Lovely. Can we get the lights, guys?

You ever heard of rat-bite fever?

Masuka, what'd I say about the f*cking rats?

You haven't found anything, won't find anything.

This is a bust, right?

In so many words.

Which means I'm just jerking off till Tucci wakes up.

So take a break. You've been working this thing 24-7.

Or are you still avoiding a personal life?

Oh, f*ck you.

And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.

Thanks, guys.

It doesn't have to be either/or.

Maybe not for you.

If I found someone, so can you, right?

Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

Tell me about it.

Yelina? Are you okay?

I'm sorry. I'm fine.

Ernesto hasn't arrived?

I'm sure he'll be here soon.

No.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Coyote?

You mean the man you paid to bring him here?

He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.

But that was a week ago, and no one in Cárdenas has heard from Ernesto.

Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

...This was his number, but it's not working anymore.

I was supposed to leave him money in a park.

Listen, my boyfriend works for the police. I'm sure he--

No, no, no. We can't go to the police.

He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba.

No, it's okay. It's okay. Dexter will know what to do.

I feel just terrible for her.

And they were supposed to be married after he got here.

I do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues.

I can talk to him.

That's really kind of you, Dex.

I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your fiancée is dead or alive?

Uh, no.

Every night after work Yelina goes across the street, to the beach.

I've seen her there, just... staring out at the water, willing him to walk out of it.

Have you ever longed for anything like that?

She wants something from me. Ever since the blow job, she assumes we've taken it to the next level.

She doesn't know yet-- I don't have a next level.

Well, when I was a kid, I would have k*lled for an Atari.

You know?

Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man...

It always comes to this once sex is introduced.

Small talk no longer cuts it.

Eventually she'll call me a science project and slam the door in my face.

But when do you think he'll wake up?

Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a k*ller out there that's into whores and security guards, but I'll bet nurses are next.

Yo, check you, all "MPD Blue".

Shanda, what are you doing here?

You have another lead on the ice-truck k*ller?

Man, I got bigger worries than that sick sh*t.

Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?

I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what you're after.

Oh, hell, no.

But my landlord's another f*cking story--

Trying to kick me out of my home.

Shanda.

He got no cause, except he's a born-again hypocrite m*therf*cker.

Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?

No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.

Morgan. Found this in evidence.

Masuka was gonna grease it through.

A cigarette butt?

Jesus, we could pull DNA off of that, or even a print.

Except it would be your print.

You were smoking on a crime scene.

Not on the crime scene-- like on the way-far end of the park.

The whole area's a crime scene. You should know that by now.

Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.

Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.

Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.

Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.

I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.

Hey, Angel, I got him!

They really found the ice-truck k*ller?

I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.

Son of a b*tch.

I have so many questions for him.

What was his message to me?

Now I need to know him.

Hi.

The f*ck are you?

Paul Bennett. Father on parole.

Dexter Morgan.

I can't think of anything clever to say.

Divorce papers -- Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I'd better make the most of them.

Your instincts were dead-on.

They're always dead-on when it comes to K*llers. Why is that?

I'm watchin' you.

What are we looking at here?

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

You?

No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?

Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you?

I like seafood.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

Not as hard as her.

Damn power outages.

I don't know, Angel.

Most firearm suicides are committed by men.

Women tend to slash their wrists, take pills, something more ladylike.

Not in Miami.

We closed a couple of su1c1de cases just like this last year, remember?

Look at this mess.

That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?

House husband. And aspiring artist.

Promising.

So, she supported him?

It looks like that.

She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

Those other suicides we closed -- those were high-powered women too, right?

I don't know. I think so.

Note to self.

I don't care what it looks like. Somebody k*lled her.

We're checking out all the possibilities, Mr. Gayle.

Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem?

You know, job stress, the usual, but she was working through it in therapy.

She have any other problems that you're aware of? Threats?

Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.

I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.

You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.

Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?

To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.

You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪

♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪

♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪

♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.Previously on "Dexter"...

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No, he's got unfinished business with me. "Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."

Paul called after you left.

He's already out of jail -- Overcrowding.

Can you believe it?

Are you f*cking my wife?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

I just wish he'd go away.

Why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you to.

It's different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love. "Barbie, be patient. "One day we'll share a cold one."

Thank god for showers. Private time to think --

Harder to come by now that I'm in a real relationship.

Do you mind?

Not at all.

Could you pass the soap?

Yeah.

It's locked!

Mom, I got to pee!

I'll be right there, sweetie!

Hold on a second, buddy!

I can't!

Sorry. One-bathroom house.

Nature calls.

Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?

Cody!

Sword fight -- I won.

Mom, I got to brush.

Whatever happened to knocking?

I'm gonna be late for school.

You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna...

I mean, what does "separation" mean to you?

What "separation" means to me is that you're separated, and you work it out. Now, this was false pretenses.

I mean, I knew she wanted a divorce when she asked for the separation -- she lied.

Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.

I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...

And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.

Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.

If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.

Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.

Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.

Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.

Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.

But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.

I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.Previously on "Dexter"...

You still don't remember anything from before?

You know, before we took you in?

No.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

Mama!

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad.

And this is Rudy.

Dexter.

Hey.

I have waited a long time to meet you.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell's this guy thinking?

And the real king is still out there.

Hungry. Ready.

He'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think --

I'm falling for him.

Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

No!

f*cking whore!

Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday.

Can't be late Monday. Throws the whole week off.

What about breakfast?

Made and eaten.

And the kids' lunches?

Packed and ready to go.

Did you tell the locksmith?

Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven-pin keyways.

I want to talk to your mom for a sec.

Are you gonna make out?

None of your business.

Are you?

Astor.

Rita, you don't have to do this, you know.

Getting att*cked by your ex-husband merits a day off.

I'm fine.

I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore.

Those days are over.

It's gonna be okay. The police have been notified.

They'll find him.

What if they don't?

I got you some pepper spray.

Just aim for the eyes.

Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

I had some at Kirk's birthday,

10 days ago.

See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here.

Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think.

It started out vanilla.

Guys, you should look at this.

Put that thing down, for God's sake.

It was addressed to Homicide.

Put it down!

Jesus, is that blood?

Morgan, get your a*s over here.

a*s en route.

You're the blood expert. What is this sh*t?

It's a little watery for jam.

Maybe you should open it.

What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released?

I got to wash my hands.

So gullible.

What is it?

Well, it's definitely blood.

Wait, there's something in here.

Marina View hotel.

It's a key.

May be some sort of promotional gag.

You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood.

Show-and-tell's over.

Let's try and find out who sent this.

Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.

Batista's still working on the expl*si*n at the smack lab.

Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.

A jar of blood --

Dramatic, cryptic, playful.

Could it be him?

Got an extra key from the manager.

Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.

The guy who checked into 103

was white and normal looking.

I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here.

It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security.

Better be ready to cancel your lunch.

Police. Open up.

Oh, my God. Jesus. Get back in your room.

Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8

out at the Marina View hotel.

I need uniformed backup, forensics.

f*ck it. Just send everybody out.

It's been a while since we went prophylactic.

Not me. Last night, I met this chick --

I'll stop you right there, Vince.

So, they tell you anything about what's inside?

No one's been inside. Too much blood.

Dexter.

Just a heads-up -- It's bad in there.

Okay.

I'm serious.

Okay.

She's not kidding. It's your wet dream in there.

Okay.

You're going in first alone.

Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report. Don't f*ck up.

Now I'm really curious.

He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me?

Mommy!

Tell me you found something, Morgan.

I talked to the guests in room 105.

They didn't see anyone go in or out.

What about across the hall?

German tourists. They got their head up their lederhosen.

They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming.

Oh, my god!

Hey. Hey, you okay?

I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there.

Never should have skipped breakfast.

Bullshit. You're shaking. What the hell happened up there?

No, I'm okay. I just need a little air.

Something finally got to you.

I guess you're human after all.

Cut him some slack, all right?

I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar.

Tell us what you saw, Dex.

How many dead?

A lot.

But no bodies, just blood --

50, 60 liters.

Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know.

You're saying there was a mass m*rder in there, but they took the bodies?

How is that possible?

There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms.

Someone would have seen corpses coming out.

I don't f*cking know.

Hey, Dexter, you all right?

I can't go back in there.

You don't have to.

Fine.

Just get yourself cleaned up and --

I don't know -- Work from the hallway or something.

You're in room 422.

Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags.

Dade county sheriff's department.

I'm looking for Rita Bennett.

That's me. Did you find Paul?

I'm sorry?

Paul Bennett.

My ex-husband att*cked me last night.

My boyfriend filed a police report.

The only report we have is the one that Mr. Bennett filed.

What? Wait.

Paul filed a police report? For what?

as*ault. Your ex-husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital.

He's pressing charges against you.

He att*cked me!

Not according to him.

All right. Can we talk about this later?

We need a formal statement.

You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station.

Fine.

Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from. All right?

Sweet.

You should really get in here, Dex.

I never seen anything like this.

Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts.

Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue. Come see.

Photos, Vince.

Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting?

The blood's not clotting?

No.

Genuine medical mystery.

Just keep getting samples.

I'll test it at the lab.

Hello? Don't hang up.

Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station.

Paul's pressing as*ault charges against me.

How's it even possible? I was defending myself.

Just stay calm. I know a lawyer.

I'll straighten it out.

I am calm.

They're the hysterical ones.

They're charging me with a class-2 felony.

Hello, Dexter? Are you there?

Yeah, I'm right here.

This is ridiculous.

I could lose my job. I could lose my kids.

I won't let that happen.

Well, I'm glad you're so confident.

Rita, just trust me.

I know how the system works.

Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.

You okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Thank you.

Yeah, bye.

Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out.

What? A wall socket?

Yeah.

Of course there's a wall socket. There's lots of wall --

Hey, you're right.

There was something plugged in here -- probably a power tool to cut them up.

Come take a look.

Photos, Vince.

Lots and lots of photos.

Open Sesame.

Blood samples for the fridge.

And you better make room. There's a lot more coming.

sh**t at the Bel Canto tonight. You in?

I'm not in the mood.

Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central.

Look at this.

They were for Nina's birthday -- backstage passes to Neil Diamond.

You're in worse shape than I thought.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

Oh, Masuka was looking for you.

Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.

Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection.

A bit of an overshare.

You want to talk about what happened today?

Already did.

Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died.

Can talk to me, you know?

Just got to open your mouth and move it.

I'll call Rudy. I'll tell him I'll be late.

Deb, seriously.

I puked.

I'm fine.

I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do.

Why do you always do this?

Do what?

You shut me out!

Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you.

I still don't know how that makes you feel.

I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call.

Fine.

Whatever.

Did Paul force his way into the house?

No.

Did you ask him to leave?

Yes, and he refused.

But in your statement, it says you invited your ex-husband into your bedroom.

He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading --

Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

And you didn't want it to escalate. I understand that, but we can't prove intent.

Your ex-husband has the injuries here, not you.

Paul has a record of spousal abuse.

Spousal abuse can be mutual.

It was never mutual.

Okay.

But the man is a model parolee.

His drug tests are clean.

He's got glowing reports from the court-appointed supervisor.

Corrections will want to see this guy transition.

I don't care!

He's not going near my children. Do you understand?

Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children.

Now, you have deposition in two days.

Do not give this man any more amm*nit*on than he already has.

Okay.

Damn.

Just blood?

What happened to the bodies?

Hell if I know.

I don't want to know.

Blood was bad enough.

No wonder you seem so amped.

Your brother must have loved it.

f*ck no. He freaked.

Really?

I thought, you know, blood was his thing.

What happened?

I don' know. It was like usual. He shut me out.

Did he say anything?

Let's not talk about Dex right now.

Was it like a panic attack?

I don't know.

He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.

Kiss me.

What's the matter? You don't even have wood.

Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk.

Yeah, but not now. I'm horny.

Maybe I should call him.

Are you f*cking kidding me?

What? We -- We bonded last weekend.

Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family?

Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants.

Deb, that's not fair.

You take me out on a -- couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn?

I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.

You know what?

Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.

Okay. I'm gonna go watch  TV.

She loved him so g*dd*mn much.

She took every one of his CDs in the separation.

She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits.

Nina loved Neil Diamond. "Song Sung Blue." "September Morn."

Oh, my god -- "Kentucky Woman."

You got to love that sh*t.

That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.

Waitress! Is there a waitress?

I need a drink. Waitress!

Bro, you're a train wreck.

Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce.

I ain't ashamed.

Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.

Look...

Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask.

Comprendo?

Eighty-six the ring.

I have to take a squirt.

She's gonna f*ck me silly.

My sister's right. I don't share my problems with her...

Or with anybody.

Harry taught me that -- Secrecy, self-reliance, and a well-stocked cupboard of hefty bags.

Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage...

Until that boy in the blood.

He scares me. I want him to go away.

You awake?

What?

Are you sure you locked the door?

Yeah, I'm positive -- Bolt and chain.

What am I gonna do?

Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

And I will.

I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own.

Fortunately, Rita's has a name.

Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103

left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.

One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.

Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.

You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.

So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.

I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --

Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.

Previously on "Dexter"...

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

It's Paul. He...

He violated Florida's three-strikes law.

The cops picked him up totally strung out on heroin.

He's back in jail.

Holy sh*t! They're f*cking fingertips.

He started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

Menthol?

Like cough drops.

I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he...

Son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

I was confused because I love you.

What did you say?

I love you.

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

No, it's -- I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.

I need an ambulance at

1228 Calendar Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.

The same images running through my head over and over.

I was there.

I saw my mother's death.

A buried memory, forgotten all these years.

It climbed inside me that day.

And it's been with me ever since --

My dark passenger.

You should be focusing on me, socio.

Seriously want to get the m*therf*cker that did this to Batista.

I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.

How's he doing? Do we know?

Still in surgery.

Laguerta's there.

God, I hate feeling so helpless.

What, no jokes about providing gross sexual comfort in a time of crisis?

Our friend was stabbed...

And he might die.

Officer Morgan.

What do you think, Dex?

He put up a fight. There was a struggle.

Attaboy, Angel.

Here, this trail --

Steady stream of drops.

He had a few seconds. Tried to move away until -- till he fell.

So much blood.

What's happening to me?

No way.

You're the one I'm supposed to meet.

In the flesh.

You know, I was just talking to someone about you.

That tickles.

Don't stop.

I wouldn't dream of stopping.

You're so different this time --

Gentle.

Are you gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again?

Actually, your...

...imperfection is what saved you the first time.

Saved me from what?

True artistry.

The message of my work is -- not in the product itself, but rather the presentation.

That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.

It's quite unsightly, actually.

Hey, you don't have to be an as*h*le about it.

Hey, hey, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to offend.

Truthfully...

I'm thankful for you.

You're my escape plan.

Escape from what?

The police.

Because of you, I've had to speed up my... project.

I need something to distract them by.

And I always found a freshly chopped-up body always does the trick.

Wait, wait! No!

Don't struggle.

That never helps.

I'm compressing your carotid artery, and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.

In about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.

Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.

Okay, I guess you went to bed.

Or you fell asleep on the couch watching "Xena" reruns, which I still think makes you a dork.

Either way, call me when you get this, okay?

Miss you.

He's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.

So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.

No. I mean, I can't.

Alright. I understand.

You need to be there for your friend.

I haven't told the kids yet.

Told them about Angel?

No, about Paul...

Being back in prison?

I hate breaking their hearts. They think so much of their dad now.

Right.

You know what?

Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.

Thanks.

They're actually coming out right now. I got to go.

Angel sustained severe internal injuries.

He lost a lot of blood.

But... the surgery was successful.

It looks like our boy's out of the woods.

I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.

But I can't focus.

I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

I need to know what it means.

Morgan.

What the f*ck is wrong with you?

I have someplace I have to be.

Well, we all got someplace to be.

But you just found out that somebody who was supposed to be your friend is gonna live.

Does that make you feel anything?

Anything at all?

Take your f*cking hand off me.

Just what I always thought.

Right.

♪ Deck the halls with parts of bodies ♪

♪ La-da-da-da dum ♪

sh*t. Just what I need.

Hey.

I know it's late.

I guess you didn't get my message.

I drove by and saw your car.

I can go.

Get your a*s in here.

It's about time you see where I live anyway.

You have no idea how much I needed this.

You feel good.

And cold. You're freezing!

Well, then stay and keep me warm.

This Batista thing has gotten to you, hasn't it?

Angel's daughter was there.

That's got to be rough.

Daughter of a cop --

Just like you.

Yeah.

I remember what that's like --

Kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.

Let's get out of town for the weekend --

Just the two of us.

We need to talk.

I'm sitting right here.

Nope.

The time has got to be right.

Okay.

It'll have to wait...

At least till we catch the as*h*le who did this to Batista.

Let me warn you -- I can be very persistent.

I need to get out of town, and I need you... to come... with me.

What I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.

I'm totally wired from all this sh*t.

Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.

My loving arms.

And...

I got a little thing to help you sleep.

That ain't no little thing.

I meant Valium.

It's one of the perks working at the hospital.

Wine and Valium?

I'll be totally helpless.

You read my mind.

Well, as I live and breathe!

You miss me?

You and the bear claws you're hiding behind your back.

This must be important.

Haven't seen much of you lately.

No rest for the wicked.

How's Gene?

Good days and bad.

He just finished his first round of radiation.

Well, he's a good guy.

Not much of a bridge player, though.

Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and I would take them to the cleaners.

I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.

Well, sure thing.

Got a date?

Not exactly.

It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

I wish I could help, but... everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basement at City Hall.

And... as you can see, I'm up to my you-know-what in year-end reports, so...

It's my lieutenant.

Camilla, is there anything you remember?

What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his home and give you a loving family.

I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.

Who found the body parts?

I did.

They were left under the tree.

I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around...

Till I found the head.

I told him not to touch anything, but he never listens.

God, Patty, you're such a b*tch.

Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary before you found the body?

There were some broken ornaments by the tree.

Who could do something like this so close to Christmas?

The Grinch.

Oh, you're a f*cking riot, Max!

Like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this.

There go our jobs.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Oh, sucks to be an elf.

...Get some visual surveillance.

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim. Cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

Yep. And after the bloodbath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the press on this one.

James!

Yeah?

I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.

And will somebody turn off this g*dd*mn snow machine?!

Your sister can help you out.

That a whole sexual-tension thing or am I missing something?

103.

It's the same numbers he left at Marina View hotel.

Any leads as to what they mean?

We've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers

-- Nothing.

They need more to go on.

First he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.

Now he leaves me this --

A calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.

It doesn't make sense.

Crime scene's wiped clean.

Another hooker?

Ho, ho, ho -- Another dead ho.

Somebody's been naughty.

Hey, Morgan.

Want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for Christmas?

And he's back!

No, thanks.

Last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.

This doesn't seem right.

Body parts scattered among the presents.

Broken ornaments.

It's not his usual meticulous style.

It seems rushed...

Haphazard.

That would explain why we can't find one of the hands.

What's wrong?

There's something underneath the torso.

Merry Christmas, Miami.

After all this time, why do you think the ice-truck k*ller has struck again?

Any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.

Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?

None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?

After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.

Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.

Previously on "Dexter"...

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim, cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Dexter...

Laura Moser...

My mother.

Laura Moser and 3 others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

Angel was stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place.

You really don't want to do this.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

Yes, yes, yes.

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Where the f*ck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.

I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

I've lived in darkness a long time.

Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I don't have much time -- or, to be more accurate, my sister doesn't have much time.

He wants me to find him, but where do I look?

I can't think.

It's too bright.

Let me know if the tape's too tight.

You know, there's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

Why are you doing this?

Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.

Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Shh, I'm just checking the supplies, okay?

Things are moving a little faster than I had planned.

This isn't you.

Pretty sure it is.

No!

I know there's more -- I've seen it.

I never wanted to hurt you.

I know. I know.

Does this make it easier for you? Because I can keep going.

Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!

There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb. I mean, you're not the only one who bought it, okay?

Your name isn't even f*cking Rudy Cooper, is it?

Nope...

But he died for a good cause.

Yeah, so will you.

You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

Not some invisible hooker -- you kidnapped a cop!

It's all part of the plan.

Oh, Jesus.

It's hard to believe it's almost come to fruition.

I mean, this is a lot of years in the making.

We're only hours away.

He wouldn't have taken Deb unless he left me everything a clever monster would need in order to find them.

♪ Born free, ♪

♪ As free as the wind blows ♪

♪ As free as the grass grows ♪

♪ Born free to follow your heart ♪

Seems I have a new screen saver.

I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded, but "Born free"?

Of course.

Thanks to Rudy, now I know where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

Born free of all that's human --

That's where I'll find him.

She knows.

She knows.

All f*cking night with that.

She knows.

Listen, Angel, we need your help.

Masuka says you were following up a lead on the ice-truck k*ller when you were att*cked.

A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

John painted her nails different colors, but it didn't go nowhere.

Except she was just cut up by the ice-truck k*ller.

Holy sh*t. Monique was a victim?

Now, we're operating on the theory that he found out you were on his trail.

And if we're right, that means you got stabbed for a reason. It wasn't no carjacking.

How did he know it was me?

No one knew what I was doing except Masuka.

Someone else had to know. Think.

I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.

But that's crazy, right?

No, she's been AWOL since going out last night to meet him.

She was supposed to come back and help me canvass, but she never made it.

That's not like her.

Angel, we got to go.

Go, just go.

There are roughly 5,000 cargo containers in the port of Miami.

Finding the one where my mother was butchered took a bit of magic.

Busted.

Busted.

sh*t.

Just a second!

I told you he was here.

There some reason you're not answering your damn phone?

Ambien.

What happened here, Dexter?

I couldn't find the remote.

Where's your sister?

She didn't come back to work, and she's not at her apartment.

I honestly don't know, sergeant.

Dexter...

We think her boyfriend Rudy's connected to the ice-truck k*ller.

We're working on getting a search warrant right now to search his home.

No. Wow...

Cut the crap.

You know something. What?

James!

I saw him last night, skulking in the lab, ordering secret blood tests.

What kind of tests?

I was looking for a type match on the blood on Batista's collar.

And whose was it?

Rudy's.

m*therf*cker.

Knock it off!

He knew all along!

Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.

Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

It was just a wild hunch.

Why didn't you tell us?

I couldn't destroy Deb's love life on a hunch.

I had to get the facts.

Here are the facts: if he kills her, it's your fault. Now, what else do you know?

That's it.

He's lying.

Give him a break, James. It's his sister, all right?

Well, if he knows what's good for her, he'll sit his a*s at home and answer the f*cking phone when it rings.

Call if you hear anything.

Hello?

Please don't hang up.

Paul?

The kids don't want to talk to you, all right?

You got to give them more time.

This isn't about them.

It's about how I was arrested.

Yeah, with a needle in your arm -- I know all about it.

Well, I don't.

Listen, I take responsibility for all the sh*t I pulled, but, Rita, I was in the program.

I kicked the hard stuff.

Well, apparently not.

I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.

It's been driving me nuts how I got -- from your house one minute to the motel room the next, completely out of my mind on junk.

Yeah, it's called a blackout, Paul.

It's called a setup.

Well done.

The last thing I remember was standing in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

Now, he could have smacked me over the head and dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.

You really are a piece of work.

I'm telling you --

Dexter is not who you think he is.

Hello?

This one, I've got to make sure we got about seven copies of these.

I want to make sure it's distributed to everyone, okay?

Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.

Some of you may have met him.

He was dating officer Morgan.

Now, she was last seen 16 hours ago, driving to meet him at the Miami Beach marina.

So we need to canvass the entire area.

Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

I've already sent a team over to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

The judge just signed off on the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

Well, let's tear that place apart.

Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

Your attention, please.

I want to introduce you to our new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.

She agreed to put her vacation on hold, come in early, to provide us with some much-needed leadership at this critical time.

Lieutenant, you're on.

I understand we have a new suspect in the ice-truck k*ller case.

We're on our way over now to search his place.

And you are...

Maria Laguerta.

And we have an officer missing, so we need to move fast.

I thought that sergeant Doakes was running that investigation.

He's out following a lead.

What lead?

He said he'd let me know if it came to anything. Now if you excuse me --

I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

Who here can get me up to speed on the way over?

I can, I guess.

You're driving.

And feel free to join us when you locate your partner.

Would you like to come with us, captain?

You seem to have everything under control.

Let's go, people.

It's in there somewhere --

My birthplace.

Now what?

No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

With billions spent on Homeland Security, it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

So much for the w*r on terror.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

I don't like this place.

Something nameless was born here...

Something that lives in the deepest, darkest hole of the thing called "Dexter."

Get in there!

Somebody else -- Get in there now!

It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

Nothing will hurt you -- I promise.

Okay, Deb... don't be dead.

sh*t.

Surprise, m*therf*cker.

Are you following me now?

You better have a hell of a reason for being here.

I'm looking for my sister.

In a cargo box?

Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.

You forget you work for the f*cking cops?

We love theories. Spin me a story, as*h*le.

What I do on my time is my business, sergeant.

Yeah, me too, and I'm on my time now.

There's no lieutenant here to save your a*s, so don't f*ck with me, Morgan!

All right, you got me.

I ordered some furniture from Thailand.

I was waiting for it to be delivered.

Lab geek -- My a*s.

Hey, what the hell's going on over here?!

Security, I need to get somebody down here right now.

Miami metro P.D.

Yeah Is this guy under arrest?

That's a good question.

You're connected to this.

I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your a*s.

Let me out of here, m*therf*cker!

Let me out of here!

Let me out! Let me out! Let me out, you piece of sh*t!

Let me out of here, you f*cking piece -- Aah!

f*ck! Let me out!

Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio, and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

Bye!

His happy place, where he kills more than time --

This is where he'd leave me a clue.

Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.

I like the cold.

You know, hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.

Yeah, and so can hypochondria.

And a home setup like this would take years to put together.

He must have hated leaving it behind.

What are you looking for?

A clue, signature or calling card --

Anything that might give us a sense of where he went.

Well, I don't think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this.

I mean, look at this place.

Hey, you were right about the victim at Santa's cottage.

He rushed his work.

He k*lled that girl to keep us busy so he could escape, but he wouldn't go without leaving us a message.

We just need to find it.

Check this out.

This is where he played with his meat.

Pretty whacked out, huh?

I can think of 101

uses for this table.

Know what I mean?

He has my sister, Vince.

Right.

I mean -- I didn't mean -- I'm sorry.

sh*t.

You're Karen, right?

That's right.

You're in charge of evidence -- this entire room -- evidence.

Take photos of every item in its original position: work-kit, packages...

Show me the inventory list when you're done.

Is he in charge?

Guess he is now.

Rita?

Rita?

Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

Can I help you?

I guess Paul never mentioned me.

I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

Right.

So, having your sponsor do your dirty work --

Which step is that?

See, he's -- he's just concerned for the kids.

No, he's concerned for himself. If you'll excuse me...

I thought he was lying, too, until I saw the proof.

What proof?

Well, the X-rays the prison doctor took of Paul's head --

They showed a skull fracture.

Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

No. You didn't.

See, after you struck him, the hospital took X-rays -- No fracture.

But in prison, a fracture.

If you know Paul, you'd know he'd bash his own head against the wall to get what he wants.

Well, I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.

No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!

The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.

His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.

Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".

Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.

Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.Previously on "Dexter"...

What happened changed something inside you, Dex.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

What can I do to help?

No blood. What a beautiful idea.

Refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "hey, want to play?"

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.

We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.

Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.

Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.

As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?

Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.

However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood. What a gorgeous idea.

Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold environment... to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man. You did... when you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam. You in?

Hey, man. Sounds good.

I thought you said you wanted to go get sh*t-faced.

I am sh*t-faced.

I showed my face to Guerrero, to his whole church.

They're gonna think I'm behind this sh*t.

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

He's escalating the thrill, posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show us what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Fingertips.

f*ckin' as*h*le, that's my girl.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

I find people around me are always making some kind of connection, like friendship or romance, but human bonds always lead to messy complications... commitment, sharing, driving people to the airport.

Besides, if I let someone get that close,

So, time to put on my mask.

I need your expertise.

I live to serve.

Excuse us, fellas.

Interesting hand job.

That's funny.

It is?

So, how long you think it's been there?

This feels familiar.

Okay. So, how long has it been there?

Blood stopped pooling, still wet... couple hours at the most.

What time was it found?

A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.

No prints. Wiped clean. Real creep show, huh?

Any sign of the rest of the body?

Just Mr. Hand. Do you think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

It's hard to say. There's blood. That's different.

Plus, it's a male victim-- haven't seen that before.

The cut appears to be almost delicate.

You see between the first and second row of carpals...

Very surgical.

Check out what else he left behind.

A little postcard to remember him by.

How far is Rand Beach from here?

This is Rand Beach.

It was renamed Petrie Beach a few years ago.

Okay, everybody.

Everybody say "stinky feet".

Stinky feet!

Wait. Nobody move. Dexter, were you smiling?

No.

Okay, we'll do another one.

This time, everybody smiles. You, too, Dex.

Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.

Shut your damn face, Deb.

Hey, language, please.

What? She always talks like that.

Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.

What's your problem?

I hate the beach.

It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.

Too bad. You're part of a family.

And being part of a family means smiling for photos.

Why should I pretend I'm happy?

Because it'll make your mom happy, and because it's how you fit in.

Remember we talked about that?

Yeah.

This is how you do it.

When somebody takes your picture, you smile.

It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

You just do it to fit in. Okay?

Okay.

All right.

Come here, handsome.

Okay. Everybody ready? One more time.

Stinky feet!

Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.

Straight to the station after, yeah. Thanks, lieutenant.

Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...

Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.

Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...

Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.Previously on "Dexter"...

Think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

It's the guard-- Tucci.

I think he's alive.

Tucci's alive?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

He's sending me a message.

He wants me to go there.

Please.

He was left here so I would k*ll him.

Just k*ll me.

I can't k*ll this man.

Taking Tucci over to County alive.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

The thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be. I'm Dexter.

I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone, maybe post-apocalypse or plague, Whatever-- No one left to act normal for, no need to hide who I really am.

It would be

...freeing.

Stop grinning like a f*cking psycho and get back to work.

Sorry, sergeant.

I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before I tear the bed apart.

I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

My shadow companion chose this place well.

This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.

All these people pawing over it seems...

He was here for days, playing with sharp objects.

I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless, amazingly so.

The only blood I found belongs to the security guard.

Has he said anything yet?

Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

Lieutenant, up here!

There's got to be something here. Find it.

The guy's not a ghost. Tony Tucci is evidence of that.

Hey, Dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet?

It's like sh**ting a Jackson Pollock.

Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.

Ready?

Okay.

What was that?

Did you see that?

What?

Damn rats.

We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their sh*t in the dust.

We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.

Lovely. Can we get the lights, guys?

You ever heard of rat-bite fever?

Masuka, what'd I say about the f*cking rats?

You haven't found anything, won't find anything.

This is a bust, right?

In so many words.

Which means I'm just jerking off till Tucci wakes up.

So take a break. You've been working this thing 24-7.

Or are you still avoiding a personal life?

Oh, f*ck you.

And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.

Thanks, guys.

It doesn't have to be either/or.

Maybe not for you.

If I found someone, so can you, right?

Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

Tell me about it.

Yelina? Are you okay?

I'm sorry. I'm fine.

Ernesto hasn't arrived?

I'm sure he'll be here soon.

No.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Coyote?

You mean the man you paid to bring him here?

He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.

But that was a week ago, and no one in Cárdenas has heard from Ernesto.

Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

...This was his number, but it's not working anymore.

I was supposed to leave him money in a park.

Listen, my boyfriend works for the police. I'm sure he--

No, no, no. We can't go to the police.

He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba.

No, it's okay. It's okay. Dexter will know what to do.

I feel just terrible for her.

And they were supposed to be married after he got here.

I do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues.

I can talk to him.

That's really kind of you, Dex.

I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your fiancée is dead or alive?

Uh, no.

Every night after work Yelina goes across the street, to the beach.

I've seen her there, just... staring out at the water, willing him to walk out of it.

Have you ever longed for anything like that?

She wants something from me. Ever since the blow job, she assumes we've taken it to the next level.

She doesn't know yet-- I don't have a next level.

Well, when I was a kid, I would have k*lled for an Atari.

You know?

Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man...

It always comes to this once sex is introduced.

Small talk no longer cuts it.

Eventually she'll call me a science project and slam the door in my face.

But when do you think he'll wake up?

Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a k*ller out there that's into whores and security guards, but I'll bet nurses are next.

Yo, check you, all "MPD Blue".

Shanda, what are you doing here?

You have another lead on the ice-truck k*ller?

Man, I got bigger worries than that sick sh*t.

Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?

I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what you're after.

Oh, hell, no.

But my landlord's another f*cking story--

Trying to kick me out of my home.

Shanda.

He got no cause, except he's a born-again hypocrite m*therf*cker.

Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?

No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.

Morgan. Found this in evidence.

Masuka was gonna grease it through.

A cigarette butt?

Jesus, we could pull DNA off of that, or even a print.

Except it would be your print.

You were smoking on a crime scene.

Not on the crime scene-- like on the way-far end of the park.

The whole area's a crime scene. You should know that by now.

Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.

Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.

Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.

Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.

I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.

Hey, Angel, I got him!

They really found the ice-truck k*ller?

I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.

Son of a b*tch.

I have so many questions for him.

What was his message to me?

Now I need to know him.

Hi.

The f*ck are you?

Paul Bennett. Father on parole.

Dexter Morgan.

I can't think of anything clever to say.

Divorce papers -- Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I'd better make the most of them.

Your instincts were dead-on.

They're always dead-on when it comes to K*llers. Why is that?

I'm watchin' you.

What are we looking at here?

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

You?

No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?

Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you?

I like seafood.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

Not as hard as her.

Damn power outages.

I don't know, Angel.

Most firearm suicides are committed by men.

Women tend to slash their wrists, take pills, something more ladylike.

Not in Miami.

We closed a couple of su1c1de cases just like this last year, remember?

Look at this mess.

That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?

House husband. And aspiring artist.

Promising.

So, she supported him?

It looks like that.

She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

Those other suicides we closed -- those were high-powered women too, right?

I don't know. I think so.

Note to self.

I don't care what it looks like. Somebody k*lled her.

We're checking out all the possibilities, Mr. Gayle.

Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem?

You know, job stress, the usual, but she was working through it in therapy.

She have any other problems that you're aware of? Threats?

Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.

I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.

You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.

Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?

To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.

You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪

♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪

♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪

♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.Previously on "Dexter"...

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No, he's got unfinished business with me. "Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."

Paul called after you left.

He's already out of jail -- Overcrowding.

Can you believe it?

Are you f*cking my wife?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

I just wish he'd go away.

Why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you to.

It's different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love. "Barbie, be patient. "One day we'll share a cold one."

Thank god for showers. Private time to think --

Harder to come by now that I'm in a real relationship.

Do you mind?

Not at all.

Could you pass the soap?

Yeah.

It's locked!

Mom, I got to pee!

I'll be right there, sweetie!

Hold on a second, buddy!

I can't!

Sorry. One-bathroom house.

Nature calls.

Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?

Cody!

Sword fight -- I won.

Mom, I got to brush.

Whatever happened to knocking?

I'm gonna be late for school.

You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna...

I mean, what does "separation" mean to you?

What "separation" means to me is that you're separated, and you work it out. Now, this was false pretenses.

I mean, I knew she wanted a divorce when she asked for the separation -- she lied.

Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.

I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...

And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.

Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.

If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.

Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.

Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.

Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.

Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.

But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.

I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.Previously on "Dexter"...

You still don't remember anything from before?

You know, before we took you in?

No.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

Mama!

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad.

And this is Rudy.

Dexter.

Hey.

I have waited a long time to meet you.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell's this guy thinking?

And the real king is still out there.

Hungry. Ready.

He'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think --

I'm falling for him.

Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

No!

f*cking whore!

Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday.

Can't be late Monday. Throws the whole week off.

What about breakfast?

Made and eaten.

And the kids' lunches?

Packed and ready to go.

Did you tell the locksmith?

Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven-pin keyways.

I want to talk to your mom for a sec.

Are you gonna make out?

None of your business.

Are you?

Astor.

Rita, you don't have to do this, you know.

Getting att*cked by your ex-husband merits a day off.

I'm fine.

I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore.

Those days are over.

It's gonna be okay. The police have been notified.

They'll find him.

What if they don't?

I got you some pepper spray.

Just aim for the eyes.

Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

I had some at Kirk's birthday,

10 days ago.

See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here.

Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think.

It started out vanilla.

Guys, you should look at this.

Put that thing down, for God's sake.

It was addressed to Homicide.

Put it down!

Jesus, is that blood?

Morgan, get your a*s over here.

a*s en route.

You're the blood expert. What is this sh*t?

It's a little watery for jam.

Maybe you should open it.

What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released?

I got to wash my hands.

So gullible.

What is it?

Well, it's definitely blood.

Wait, there's something in here.

Marina View hotel.

It's a key.

May be some sort of promotional gag.

You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood.

Show-and-tell's over.

Let's try and find out who sent this.

Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.

Batista's still working on the expl*si*n at the smack lab.

Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.

A jar of blood --

Dramatic, cryptic, playful.

Could it be him?

Got an extra key from the manager.

Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.

The guy who checked into 103

was white and normal looking.

I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here.

It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security.

Better be ready to cancel your lunch.

Police. Open up.

Oh, my God. Jesus. Get back in your room.

Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8

out at the Marina View hotel.

I need uniformed backup, forensics.

f*ck it. Just send everybody out.

It's been a while since we went prophylactic.

Not me. Last night, I met this chick --

I'll stop you right there, Vince.

So, they tell you anything about what's inside?

No one's been inside. Too much blood.

Dexter.

Just a heads-up -- It's bad in there.

Okay.

I'm serious.

Okay.

She's not kidding. It's your wet dream in there.

Okay.

You're going in first alone.

Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report. Don't f*ck up.

Now I'm really curious.

He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me?

Mommy!

Tell me you found something, Morgan.

I talked to the guests in room 105.

They didn't see anyone go in or out.

What about across the hall?

German tourists. They got their head up their lederhosen.

They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming.

Oh, my god!

Hey. Hey, you okay?

I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there.

Never should have skipped breakfast.

Bullshit. You're shaking. What the hell happened up there?

No, I'm okay. I just need a little air.

Something finally got to you.

I guess you're human after all.

Cut him some slack, all right?

I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar.

Tell us what you saw, Dex.

How many dead?

A lot.

But no bodies, just blood --

50, 60 liters.

Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know.

You're saying there was a mass m*rder in there, but they took the bodies?

How is that possible?

There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms.

Someone would have seen corpses coming out.

I don't f*cking know.

Hey, Dexter, you all right?

I can't go back in there.

You don't have to.

Fine.

Just get yourself cleaned up and --

I don't know -- Work from the hallway or something.

You're in room 422.

Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags.

Dade county sheriff's department.

I'm looking for Rita Bennett.

That's me. Did you find Paul?

I'm sorry?

Paul Bennett.

My ex-husband att*cked me last night.

My boyfriend filed a police report.

The only report we have is the one that Mr. Bennett filed.

What? Wait.

Paul filed a police report? For what?

as*ault. Your ex-husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital.

He's pressing charges against you.

He att*cked me!

Not according to him.

All right. Can we talk about this later?

We need a formal statement.

You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station.

Fine.

Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from. All right?

Sweet.

You should really get in here, Dex.

I never seen anything like this.

Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts.

Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue. Come see.

Photos, Vince.

Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting?

The blood's not clotting?

No.

Genuine medical mystery.

Just keep getting samples.

I'll test it at the lab.

Hello? Don't hang up.

Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station.

Paul's pressing as*ault charges against me.

How's it even possible? I was defending myself.

Just stay calm. I know a lawyer.

I'll straighten it out.

I am calm.

They're the hysterical ones.

They're charging me with a class-2 felony.

Hello, Dexter? Are you there?

Yeah, I'm right here.

This is ridiculous.

I could lose my job. I could lose my kids.

I won't let that happen.

Well, I'm glad you're so confident.

Rita, just trust me.

I know how the system works.

Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.

You okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Thank you.

Yeah, bye.

Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out.

What? A wall socket?

Yeah.

Of course there's a wall socket. There's lots of wall --

Hey, you're right.

There was something plugged in here -- probably a power tool to cut them up.

Come take a look.

Photos, Vince.

Lots and lots of photos.

Open Sesame.

Blood samples for the fridge.

And you better make room. There's a lot more coming.

sh**t at the Bel Canto tonight. You in?

I'm not in the mood.

Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central.

Look at this.

They were for Nina's birthday -- backstage passes to Neil Diamond.

You're in worse shape than I thought.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

Oh, Masuka was looking for you.

Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.

Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection.

A bit of an overshare.

You want to talk about what happened today?

Already did.

Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died.

Can talk to me, you know?

Just got to open your mouth and move it.

I'll call Rudy. I'll tell him I'll be late.

Deb, seriously.

I puked.

I'm fine.

I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do.

Why do you always do this?

Do what?

You shut me out!

Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you.

I still don't know how that makes you feel.

I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call.

Fine.

Whatever.

Did Paul force his way into the house?

No.

Did you ask him to leave?

Yes, and he refused.

But in your statement, it says you invited your ex-husband into your bedroom.

He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading --

Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

And you didn't want it to escalate. I understand that, but we can't prove intent.

Your ex-husband has the injuries here, not you.

Paul has a record of spousal abuse.

Spousal abuse can be mutual.

It was never mutual.

Okay.

But the man is a model parolee.

His drug tests are clean.

He's got glowing reports from the court-appointed supervisor.

Corrections will want to see this guy transition.

I don't care!

He's not going near my children. Do you understand?

Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children.

Now, you have deposition in two days.

Do not give this man any more amm*nit*on than he already has.

Okay.

Damn.

Just blood?

What happened to the bodies?

Hell if I know.

I don't want to know.

Blood was bad enough.

No wonder you seem so amped.

Your brother must have loved it.

f*ck no. He freaked.

Really?

I thought, you know, blood was his thing.

What happened?

I don' know. It was like usual. He shut me out.

Did he say anything?

Let's not talk about Dex right now.

Was it like a panic attack?

I don't know.

He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.

Kiss me.

What's the matter? You don't even have wood.

Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk.

Yeah, but not now. I'm horny.

Maybe I should call him.

Are you f*cking kidding me?

What? We -- We bonded last weekend.

Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family?

Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants.

Deb, that's not fair.

You take me out on a -- couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn?

I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.

You know what?

Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.

Okay. I'm gonna go watch  TV.

She loved him so g*dd*mn much.

She took every one of his CDs in the separation.

She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits.

Nina loved Neil Diamond. "Song Sung Blue." "September Morn."

Oh, my god -- "Kentucky Woman."

You got to love that sh*t.

That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.

Waitress! Is there a waitress?

I need a drink. Waitress!

Bro, you're a train wreck.

Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce.

I ain't ashamed.

Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.

Look...

Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask.

Comprendo?

Eighty-six the ring.

I have to take a squirt.

She's gonna f*ck me silly.

My sister's right. I don't share my problems with her...

Or with anybody.

Harry taught me that -- Secrecy, self-reliance, and a well-stocked cupboard of hefty bags.

Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage...

Until that boy in the blood.

He scares me. I want him to go away.

You awake?

What?

Are you sure you locked the door?

Yeah, I'm positive -- Bolt and chain.

What am I gonna do?

Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

And I will.

I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own.

Fortunately, Rita's has a name.

Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103

left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.

One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.

Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.

You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.

So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.

I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --

Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.

Previously on "Dexter"...

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

It's Paul. He...

He violated Florida's three-strikes law.

The cops picked him up totally strung out on heroin.

He's back in jail.

Holy sh*t! They're f*cking fingertips.

He started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

Menthol?

Like cough drops.

I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he...

Son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

I was confused because I love you.

What did you say?

I love you.

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

No, it's -- I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.

I need an ambulance at

1228 Calendar Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.

The same images running through my head over and over.

I was there.

I saw my mother's death.

A buried memory, forgotten all these years.

It climbed inside me that day.

And it's been with me ever since --

My dark passenger.

You should be focusing on me, socio.

Seriously want to get the m*therf*cker that did this to Batista.

I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.

How's he doing? Do we know?

Still in surgery.

Laguerta's there.

God, I hate feeling so helpless.

What, no jokes about providing gross sexual comfort in a time of crisis?

Our friend was stabbed...

And he might die.

Officer Morgan.

What do you think, Dex?

He put up a fight. There was a struggle.

Attaboy, Angel.

Here, this trail --

Steady stream of drops.

He had a few seconds. Tried to move away until -- till he fell.

So much blood.

What's happening to me?

No way.

You're the one I'm supposed to meet.

In the flesh.

You know, I was just talking to someone about you.

That tickles.

Don't stop.

I wouldn't dream of stopping.

You're so different this time --

Gentle.

Are you gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again?

Actually, your...

...imperfection is what saved you the first time.

Saved me from what?

True artistry.

The message of my work is -- not in the product itself, but rather the presentation.

That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.

It's quite unsightly, actually.

Hey, you don't have to be an as*h*le about it.

Hey, hey, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to offend.

Truthfully...

I'm thankful for you.

You're my escape plan.

Escape from what?

The police.

Because of you, I've had to speed up my... project.

I need something to distract them by.

And I always found a freshly chopped-up body always does the trick.

Wait, wait! No!

Don't struggle.

That never helps.

I'm compressing your carotid artery, and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.

In about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.

Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.

Okay, I guess you went to bed.

Or you fell asleep on the couch watching "Xena" reruns, which I still think makes you a dork.

Either way, call me when you get this, okay?

Miss you.

He's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.

So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.

No. I mean, I can't.

Alright. I understand.

You need to be there for your friend.

I haven't told the kids yet.

Told them about Angel?

No, about Paul...

Being back in prison?

I hate breaking their hearts. They think so much of their dad now.

Right.

You know what?

Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.

Thanks.

They're actually coming out right now. I got to go.

Angel sustained severe internal injuries.

He lost a lot of blood.

But... the surgery was successful.

It looks like our boy's out of the woods.

I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.

But I can't focus.

I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

I need to know what it means.

Morgan.

What the f*ck is wrong with you?

I have someplace I have to be.

Well, we all got someplace to be.

But you just found out that somebody who was supposed to be your friend is gonna live.

Does that make you feel anything?

Anything at all?

Take your f*cking hand off me.

Just what I always thought.

Right.

♪ Deck the halls with parts of bodies ♪

♪ La-da-da-da dum ♪

sh*t. Just what I need.

Hey.

I know it's late.

I guess you didn't get my message.

I drove by and saw your car.

I can go.

Get your a*s in here.

It's about time you see where I live anyway.

You have no idea how much I needed this.

You feel good.

And cold. You're freezing!

Well, then stay and keep me warm.

This Batista thing has gotten to you, hasn't it?

Angel's daughter was there.

That's got to be rough.

Daughter of a cop --

Just like you.

Yeah.

I remember what that's like --

Kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.

Let's get out of town for the weekend --

Just the two of us.

We need to talk.

I'm sitting right here.

Nope.

The time has got to be right.

Okay.

It'll have to wait...

At least till we catch the as*h*le who did this to Batista.

Let me warn you -- I can be very persistent.

I need to get out of town, and I need you... to come... with me.

What I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.

I'm totally wired from all this sh*t.

Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.

My loving arms.

And...

I got a little thing to help you sleep.

That ain't no little thing.

I meant Valium.

It's one of the perks working at the hospital.

Wine and Valium?

I'll be totally helpless.

You read my mind.

Well, as I live and breathe!

You miss me?

You and the bear claws you're hiding behind your back.

This must be important.

Haven't seen much of you lately.

No rest for the wicked.

How's Gene?

Good days and bad.

He just finished his first round of radiation.

Well, he's a good guy.

Not much of a bridge player, though.

Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and I would take them to the cleaners.

I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.

Well, sure thing.

Got a date?

Not exactly.

It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

I wish I could help, but... everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basement at City Hall.

And... as you can see, I'm up to my you-know-what in year-end reports, so...

It's my lieutenant.

Camilla, is there anything you remember?

What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his home and give you a loving family.

I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.

Who found the body parts?

I did.

They were left under the tree.

I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around...

Till I found the head.

I told him not to touch anything, but he never listens.

God, Patty, you're such a b*tch.

Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary before you found the body?

There were some broken ornaments by the tree.

Who could do something like this so close to Christmas?

The Grinch.

Oh, you're a f*cking riot, Max!

Like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this.

There go our jobs.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Oh, sucks to be an elf.

...Get some visual surveillance.

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim. Cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

Yep. And after the bloodbath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the press on this one.

James!

Yeah?

I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.

And will somebody turn off this g*dd*mn snow machine?!

Your sister can help you out.

That a whole sexual-tension thing or am I missing something?

103.

It's the same numbers he left at Marina View hotel.

Any leads as to what they mean?

We've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers

-- Nothing.

They need more to go on.

First he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.

Now he leaves me this --

A calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.

It doesn't make sense.

Crime scene's wiped clean.

Another hooker?

Ho, ho, ho -- Another dead ho.

Somebody's been naughty.

Hey, Morgan.

Want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for Christmas?

And he's back!

No, thanks.

Last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.

This doesn't seem right.

Body parts scattered among the presents.

Broken ornaments.

It's not his usual meticulous style.

It seems rushed...

Haphazard.

That would explain why we can't find one of the hands.

What's wrong?

There's something underneath the torso.

Merry Christmas, Miami.

After all this time, why do you think the ice-truck k*ller has struck again?

Any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.

Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?

None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?

After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.

Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.

Previously on "Dexter"...

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim, cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Dexter...

Laura Moser...

My mother.

Laura Moser and 3 others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

Angel was stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place.

You really don't want to do this.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

Yes, yes, yes.

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Where the f*ck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.

I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

I've lived in darkness a long time.

Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I don't have much time -- or, to be more accurate, my sister doesn't have much time.

He wants me to find him, but where do I look?

I can't think.

It's too bright.

Let me know if the tape's too tight.

You know, there's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

Why are you doing this?

Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.

Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Shh, I'm just checking the supplies, okay?

Things are moving a little faster than I had planned.

This isn't you.

Pretty sure it is.

No!

I know there's more -- I've seen it.

I never wanted to hurt you.

I know. I know.

Does this make it easier for you? Because I can keep going.

Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!

There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb. I mean, you're not the only one who bought it, okay?

Your name isn't even f*cking Rudy Cooper, is it?

Nope...

But he died for a good cause.

Yeah, so will you.

You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

Not some invisible hooker -- you kidnapped a cop!

It's all part of the plan.

Oh, Jesus.

It's hard to believe it's almost come to fruition.

I mean, this is a lot of years in the making.

We're only hours away.

He wouldn't have taken Deb unless he left me everything a clever monster would need in order to find them.

♪ Born free, ♪

♪ As free as the wind blows ♪

♪ As free as the grass grows ♪

♪ Born free to follow your heart ♪

Seems I have a new screen saver.

I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded, but "Born free"?

Of course.

Thanks to Rudy, now I know where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

Born free of all that's human --

That's where I'll find him.

She knows.

She knows.

All f*cking night with that.

She knows.

Listen, Angel, we need your help.

Masuka says you were following up a lead on the ice-truck k*ller when you were att*cked.

A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

John painted her nails different colors, but it didn't go nowhere.

Except she was just cut up by the ice-truck k*ller.

Holy sh*t. Monique was a victim?

Now, we're operating on the theory that he found out you were on his trail.

And if we're right, that means you got stabbed for a reason. It wasn't no carjacking.

How did he know it was me?

No one knew what I was doing except Masuka.

Someone else had to know. Think.

I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.

But that's crazy, right?

No, she's been AWOL since going out last night to meet him.

She was supposed to come back and help me canvass, but she never made it.

That's not like her.

Angel, we got to go.

Go, just go.

There are roughly 5,000 cargo containers in the port of Miami.

Finding the one where my mother was butchered took a bit of magic.

Busted.

Busted.

sh*t.

Just a second!

I told you he was here.

There some reason you're not answering your damn phone?

Ambien.

What happened here, Dexter?

I couldn't find the remote.

Where's your sister?

She didn't come back to work, and she's not at her apartment.

I honestly don't know, sergeant.

Dexter...

We think her boyfriend Rudy's connected to the ice-truck k*ller.

We're working on getting a search warrant right now to search his home.

No. Wow...

Cut the crap.

You know something. What?

James!

I saw him last night, skulking in the lab, ordering secret blood tests.

What kind of tests?

I was looking for a type match on the blood on Batista's collar.

And whose was it?

Rudy's.

m*therf*cker.

Knock it off!

He knew all along!

Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.

Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

It was just a wild hunch.

Why didn't you tell us?

I couldn't destroy Deb's love life on a hunch.

I had to get the facts.

Here are the facts: if he kills her, it's your fault. Now, what else do you know?

That's it.

He's lying.

Give him a break, James. It's his sister, all right?

Well, if he knows what's good for her, he'll sit his a*s at home and answer the f*cking phone when it rings.

Call if you hear anything.

Hello?

Please don't hang up.

Paul?

The kids don't want to talk to you, all right?

You got to give them more time.

This isn't about them.

It's about how I was arrested.

Yeah, with a needle in your arm -- I know all about it.

Well, I don't.

Listen, I take responsibility for all the sh*t I pulled, but, Rita, I was in the program.

I kicked the hard stuff.

Well, apparently not.

I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.

It's been driving me nuts how I got -- from your house one minute to the motel room the next, completely out of my mind on junk.

Yeah, it's called a blackout, Paul.

It's called a setup.

Well done.

The last thing I remember was standing in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

Now, he could have smacked me over the head and dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.

You really are a piece of work.

I'm telling you --

Dexter is not who you think he is.

Hello?

This one, I've got to make sure we got about seven copies of these.

I want to make sure it's distributed to everyone, okay?

Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.

Some of you may have met him.

He was dating officer Morgan.

Now, she was last seen 16 hours ago, driving to meet him at the Miami Beach marina.

So we need to canvass the entire area.

Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

I've already sent a team over to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

The judge just signed off on the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

Well, let's tear that place apart.

Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

Your attention, please.

I want to introduce you to our new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.

She agreed to put her vacation on hold, come in early, to provide us with some much-needed leadership at this critical time.

Lieutenant, you're on.

I understand we have a new suspect in the ice-truck k*ller case.

We're on our way over now to search his place.

And you are...

Maria Laguerta.

And we have an officer missing, so we need to move fast.

I thought that sergeant Doakes was running that investigation.

He's out following a lead.

What lead?

He said he'd let me know if it came to anything. Now if you excuse me --

I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

Who here can get me up to speed on the way over?

I can, I guess.

You're driving.

And feel free to join us when you locate your partner.

Would you like to come with us, captain?

You seem to have everything under control.

Let's go, people.

It's in there somewhere --

My birthplace.

Now what?

No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

With billions spent on Homeland Security, it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

So much for the w*r on terror.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

I don't like this place.

Something nameless was born here...

Something that lives in the deepest, darkest hole of the thing called "Dexter."

Get in there!

Somebody else -- Get in there now!

It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

Nothing will hurt you -- I promise.

Okay, Deb... don't be dead.

sh*t.

Surprise, m*therf*cker.

Are you following me now?

You better have a hell of a reason for being here.

I'm looking for my sister.

In a cargo box?

Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.

You forget you work for the f*cking cops?

We love theories. Spin me a story, as*h*le.

What I do on my time is my business, sergeant.

Yeah, me too, and I'm on my time now.

There's no lieutenant here to save your a*s, so don't f*ck with me, Morgan!

All right, you got me.

I ordered some furniture from Thailand.

I was waiting for it to be delivered.

Lab geek -- My a*s.

Hey, what the hell's going on over here?!

Security, I need to get somebody down here right now.

Miami metro P.D.

Yeah Is this guy under arrest?

That's a good question.

You're connected to this.

I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your a*s.

Let me out of here, m*therf*cker!

Let me out of here!

Let me out! Let me out! Let me out, you piece of sh*t!

Let me out of here, you f*cking piece -- Aah!

f*ck! Let me out!

Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio, and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

Bye!

His happy place, where he kills more than time --

This is where he'd leave me a clue.

Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.

I like the cold.

You know, hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.

Yeah, and so can hypochondria.

And a home setup like this would take years to put together.

He must have hated leaving it behind.

What are you looking for?

A clue, signature or calling card --

Anything that might give us a sense of where he went.

Well, I don't think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this.

I mean, look at this place.

Hey, you were right about the victim at Santa's cottage.

He rushed his work.

He k*lled that girl to keep us busy so he could escape, but he wouldn't go without leaving us a message.

We just need to find it.

Check this out.

This is where he played with his meat.

Pretty whacked out, huh?

I can think of 101

uses for this table.

Know what I mean?

He has my sister, Vince.

Right.

I mean -- I didn't mean -- I'm sorry.

sh*t.

You're Karen, right?

That's right.

You're in charge of evidence -- this entire room -- evidence.

Take photos of every item in its original position: work-kit, packages...

Show me the inventory list when you're done.

Is he in charge?

Guess he is now.

Rita?

Rita?

Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

Can I help you?

I guess Paul never mentioned me.

I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

Right.

So, having your sponsor do your dirty work --

Which step is that?

See, he's -- he's just concerned for the kids.

No, he's concerned for himself. If you'll excuse me...

I thought he was lying, too, until I saw the proof.

What proof?

Well, the X-rays the prison doctor took of Paul's head --

They showed a skull fracture.

Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

No. You didn't.

See, after you struck him, the hospital took X-rays -- No fracture.

But in prison, a fracture.

If you know Paul, you'd know he'd bash his own head against the wall to get what he wants.

Well, I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.

No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!

The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.

His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.Previously on "Dexter"..

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again.

Has to happen.

There he is. He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

You better be a cop.

No... Forensics.

There is no blood near the body at all.

It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

One of these days, you're gonna tell me.

I told you blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

How the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Please, you have to understand.

Trust me. I definitely understand.

Hello?

What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

They found another hooker.

Another one?

That's the third one in five months.

Third? You mean there's a...

Serial k*ller, that's right.

Dex, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Of course, you have to learn how to spot them, but I can teach you.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

♪ ven conmigo... ♪

♪ junto a mi corazón ♪

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.

Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".

Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.

Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.Previously on "Dexter"...

What happened changed something inside you, Dex.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

What can I do to help?

No blood. What a beautiful idea.

Refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "hey, want to play?"

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.

We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.

Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.

Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.

As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?

Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.

However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood. What a gorgeous idea.

Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold environment... to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man. You did... when you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam. You in?

Hey, man. Sounds good.

I thought you said you wanted to go get sh*t-faced.

I am sh*t-faced.

I showed my face to Guerrero, to his whole church.

They're gonna think I'm behind this sh*t.

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

He's escalating the thrill, posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show us what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Fingertips.

f*ckin' as*h*le, that's my girl.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

I find people around me are always making some kind of connection, like friendship or romance, but human bonds always lead to messy complications... commitment, sharing, driving people to the airport.

Besides, if I let someone get that close,

So, time to put on my mask.

I need your expertise.

I live to serve.

Excuse us, fellas.

Interesting hand job.

That's funny.

It is?

So, how long you think it's been there?

This feels familiar.

Okay. So, how long has it been there?

Blood stopped pooling, still wet... couple hours at the most.

What time was it found?

A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.

No prints. Wiped clean. Real creep show, huh?

Any sign of the rest of the body?

Just Mr. Hand. Do you think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

It's hard to say. There's blood. That's different.

Plus, it's a male victim-- haven't seen that before.

The cut appears to be almost delicate.

You see between the first and second row of carpals...

Very surgical.

Check out what else he left behind.

A little postcard to remember him by.

How far is Rand Beach from here?

This is Rand Beach.

It was renamed Petrie Beach a few years ago.

Okay, everybody.

Everybody say "stinky feet".

Stinky feet!

Wait. Nobody move. Dexter, were you smiling?

No.

Okay, we'll do another one.

This time, everybody smiles. You, too, Dex.

Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.

Shut your damn face, Deb.

Hey, language, please.

What? She always talks like that.

Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.

What's your problem?

I hate the beach.

It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.

Too bad. You're part of a family.

And being part of a family means smiling for photos.

Why should I pretend I'm happy?

Because it'll make your mom happy, and because it's how you fit in.

Remember we talked about that?

Yeah.

This is how you do it.

When somebody takes your picture, you smile.

It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

You just do it to fit in. Okay?

Okay.

All right.

Come here, handsome.

Okay. Everybody ready? One more time.

Stinky feet!

Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.

Straight to the station after, yeah. Thanks, lieutenant.

Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...

Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.

Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...

Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.Previously on "Dexter"...

Think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

It's the guard-- Tucci.

I think he's alive.

Tucci's alive?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

He's sending me a message.

He wants me to go there.

Please.

He was left here so I would k*ll him.

Just k*ll me.

I can't k*ll this man.

Taking Tucci over to County alive.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

The thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be. I'm Dexter.

I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone, maybe post-apocalypse or plague, Whatever-- No one left to act normal for, no need to hide who I really am.

It would be

...freeing.

Stop grinning like a f*cking psycho and get back to work.

Sorry, sergeant.

I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before I tear the bed apart.

I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

My shadow companion chose this place well.

This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.

All these people pawing over it seems...

He was here for days, playing with sharp objects.

I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless, amazingly so.

The only blood I found belongs to the security guard.

Has he said anything yet?

Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

Lieutenant, up here!

There's got to be something here. Find it.

The guy's not a ghost. Tony Tucci is evidence of that.

Hey, Dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet?

It's like sh**ting a Jackson Pollock.

Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.

Ready?

Okay.

What was that?

Did you see that?

What?

Damn rats.

We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their sh*t in the dust.

We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.

Lovely. Can we get the lights, guys?

You ever heard of rat-bite fever?

Masuka, what'd I say about the f*cking rats?

You haven't found anything, won't find anything.

This is a bust, right?

In so many words.

Which means I'm just jerking off till Tucci wakes up.

So take a break. You've been working this thing 24-7.

Or are you still avoiding a personal life?

Oh, f*ck you.

And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.

Thanks, guys.

It doesn't have to be either/or.

Maybe not for you.

If I found someone, so can you, right?

Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

Tell me about it.

Yelina? Are you okay?

I'm sorry. I'm fine.

Ernesto hasn't arrived?

I'm sure he'll be here soon.

No.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Coyote?

You mean the man you paid to bring him here?

He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.

But that was a week ago, and no one in Cárdenas has heard from Ernesto.

Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

...This was his number, but it's not working anymore.

I was supposed to leave him money in a park.

Listen, my boyfriend works for the police. I'm sure he--

No, no, no. We can't go to the police.

He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba.

No, it's okay. It's okay. Dexter will know what to do.

I feel just terrible for her.

And they were supposed to be married after he got here.

I do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues.

I can talk to him.

That's really kind of you, Dex.

I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your fiancée is dead or alive?

Uh, no.

Every night after work Yelina goes across the street, to the beach.

I've seen her there, just... staring out at the water, willing him to walk out of it.

Have you ever longed for anything like that?

She wants something from me. Ever since the blow job, she assumes we've taken it to the next level.

She doesn't know yet-- I don't have a next level.

Well, when I was a kid, I would have k*lled for an Atari.

You know?

Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man...

It always comes to this once sex is introduced.

Small talk no longer cuts it.

Eventually she'll call me a science project and slam the door in my face.

But when do you think he'll wake up?

Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a k*ller out there that's into whores and security guards, but I'll bet nurses are next.

Yo, check you, all "MPD Blue".

Shanda, what are you doing here?

You have another lead on the ice-truck k*ller?

Man, I got bigger worries than that sick sh*t.

Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?

I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what you're after.

Oh, hell, no.

But my landlord's another f*cking story--

Trying to kick me out of my home.

Shanda.

He got no cause, except he's a born-again hypocrite m*therf*cker.

Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?

No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.

Morgan. Found this in evidence.

Masuka was gonna grease it through.

A cigarette butt?

Jesus, we could pull DNA off of that, or even a print.

Except it would be your print.

You were smoking on a crime scene.

Not on the crime scene-- like on the way-far end of the park.

The whole area's a crime scene. You should know that by now.

Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.

Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.

Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.

Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.

I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.

Hey, Angel, I got him!

They really found the ice-truck k*ller?

I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.

Son of a b*tch.

I have so many questions for him.

What was his message to me?

Now I need to know him.

Hi.

The f*ck are you?

Paul Bennett. Father on parole.

Dexter Morgan.

I can't think of anything clever to say.

Divorce papers -- Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I'd better make the most of them.

Your instincts were dead-on.

They're always dead-on when it comes to K*llers. Why is that?

I'm watchin' you.

What are we looking at here?

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

You?

No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?

Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you?

I like seafood.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

Not as hard as her.

Damn power outages.

I don't know, Angel.

Most firearm suicides are committed by men.

Women tend to slash their wrists, take pills, something more ladylike.

Not in Miami.

We closed a couple of su1c1de cases just like this last year, remember?

Look at this mess.

That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?

House husband. And aspiring artist.

Promising.

So, she supported him?

It looks like that.

She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

Those other suicides we closed -- those were high-powered women too, right?

I don't know. I think so.

Note to self.

I don't care what it looks like. Somebody k*lled her.

We're checking out all the possibilities, Mr. Gayle.

Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem?

You know, job stress, the usual, but she was working through it in therapy.

She have any other problems that you're aware of? Threats?

Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.

I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.

You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.

Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?

To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.

You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪

♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪

♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪

♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.Previously on "Dexter"...

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No, he's got unfinished business with me. "Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."

Paul called after you left.

He's already out of jail -- Overcrowding.

Can you believe it?

Are you f*cking my wife?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

I just wish he'd go away.

Why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you to.

It's different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love. "Barbie, be patient. "One day we'll share a cold one."

Thank god for showers. Private time to think --

Harder to come by now that I'm in a real relationship.

Do you mind?

Not at all.

Could you pass the soap?

Yeah.

It's locked!

Mom, I got to pee!

I'll be right there, sweetie!

Hold on a second, buddy!

I can't!

Sorry. One-bathroom house.

Nature calls.

Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?

Cody!

Sword fight -- I won.

Mom, I got to brush.

Whatever happened to knocking?

I'm gonna be late for school.

You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna...

I mean, what does "separation" mean to you?

What "separation" means to me is that you're separated, and you work it out. Now, this was false pretenses.

I mean, I knew she wanted a divorce when she asked for the separation -- she lied.

Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.

I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...

And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.

Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.

If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.

Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.

Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again-- has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town. I love the Cuban food.

Pork sandwiches-- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for something different now.

There he is-- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

What do you want?

I want you to be quiet.

Now drive.

Turn here.

You have to listen...

Do what I say.

Look.

No.

Uh, yes.

No, no!

It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please...

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.

One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.

I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is--

Stop! That never helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg. Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself. I couldn't. I--

Please, you have to understand...

Trust me, I definitely understand.

See, I can't help myself, either.

Children, I could never do that. Not like you.

Never, ever kids.

Why?

I have standards.

Soon you'll be packed into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties in my own small corner of the world.

It'll be a neater, happier place.

I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.

Ahoy!

Ahoy, there, captain! Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't k*ll them...

Honest.

You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy little creep, Dad.

He was barking all night, and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick, and that lousy dog was yapping at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk!

There were a lot of bones in there, Dexter, and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood-- sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times, it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry, my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.

Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one, taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please, as soon as you get in, I'm at a crime scene by the sh*thole the Seven Seas motel, and I need you here. Okay?

Dex? Please...

Pretty f*cking please with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.

I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb.

There's something strange and disarming about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque killings look staged, like you're in a new and daring section of Disney World--

Dahmer Land*.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb...

Where the hell do you keep your g*n?

They found another hooker, in the pool.

Another?

Chopped up in bits and pieces.

That's the third one in 5 months.

Third? You mean there's a--

A serial k*ller, that's right.

The other 2 were in Broward, chopped up just like this one.

Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on Vice, so Laguerta sent me to my room and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game. You could take a lesson.

In what, a*s-kissing?

Politics.

I just want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

You can't get so emotionally invested.

You always say that.

So did Dad.

Yeah, but he also said, "go after what you want."

I want out of Vice and into Homicide.

What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know, with these types of murders.

Only sometimes.

Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some ideas off of you later?

You know I always get smarter when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta and talk to Captain Matthews.

He and Dad were tight. Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when you talk to the Captain.

It'll help your cause.

That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.

Saw your sister.

Damn, looking hot.

Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

So... Why are you here?

It's a crime scene.

Yeah.

But you do blood spatter.

So?

So?... There's no blood here.

What was that?

Yeah. There's no blood in or on or near the body at all. It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood. No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that? No blood.

What a beautiful idea!

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say. The body's in good shape.

She got a nice a*s, too.

Head is over there, if you want to take a look.

This is unique.

No sh*t.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish. No terminó.

It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces, almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make a fourth cut but stopped.

It's possible he got interrupted.

Laguerta's looking for a witness, working on the motel porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think. I have to get out of here.

Dex, ¿dónde va? Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that. It's one of those mating rituals which I really don't understand.

But that bloodless body-- this guy may have exceeded my own abilities.

Morning, Dex.

Morning.

Hey, Dex.

Hey, Sue. Dan.

How are the families?

Good. You?

See you at the next bloodbath?

Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people, and they work hard.

But with the solve rate for murders at about 20%, Miami is a great place for me, a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

I like your other outfit better.

You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked. Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy, but she needs to get laid.

I guess. So congrats!

So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on your mental autopsy 'cause I could use your theories. And thanks for the f*cking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your fingernails clean?

Never leave home without my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out. It fills my nights.

You have a morbid sense of fun.

That's probably true.

You should find a pretty girl.

I found you.

Charming like your father. Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I bring doughnuts to?

Angel, ¿una más?

Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

Where the hell you been?

Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders, this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple didn't die by the hands of a professional.

No, this is child's play. Messy work--

All that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting.

You give me the f*cking creeps, you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

f*ck you.

Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a f*cking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the f*ck up and write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho, and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in. Two scumbags slashed to hell, dealer stole the dr*gs.

Wham, bam, done. And I don't give a sh*t what you say because that's what happened and that's who I'm looking for.

Hey, we are looking for a m*therf*cking thief dealer.

You got it?

Okay. Sure.

I guess. But I should get over there.

Then get over there already, you f*cking weirdo.

I need it quick.

I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops, all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?

So this k*ller used a sword?

No.

Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter. Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond of blood right there?

That's from the initial s*ab.

The male victim was standing right here, and the k*ller plunged his knife into the shoulder, severing the carotid artery, and-- blpph Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?

Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice, clean sprays of blood, that can only happen when you're holding something light and moving quick-- nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips. Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice, but, hey, you never know.

Now what?

Now I eat!

The problem with eating and driving, which I love to do, is not being able to employ the 10:00-2:00 hand position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell in love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane Saunders--

A sweet mother of two married to a successful banker--

All living a pleasant life until she, unfortunately, disappeared, leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever.

The cops arrested my favorite valet, but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me, especially dogs.

I don't think they approve of what I sometimes do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily as I can recognize Jaworski or any other k*ller.

Interesting taste in literature.

His needs are evolving, turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted to k*ll anything else?

You know, something bigger than a dog?

Yes.

Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night. Date night in Miami.

Every night is a date night in Miami, and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have anything against women, and I certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it's always just seemed so... undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of trying to look normal, I think I met the right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a domestic-dispute call, introduced us, and we've been dating for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late. I'll just be a sec.

I have to change.

Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever. High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate, and strawberry.

No coffee?

Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby, the crack addict, repeatedly r*ped her, knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

Of course I'll be back.

I meant Dexter.

You'll be asleep.

No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and we'll all play cards.

Texas Hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

Ready?

Yeah.

Needless to say, I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile... But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there. I'll be right back.

Son of a whore.

Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta, this as*h*le k*ller, this maricón savage who makes us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays-- that's what I always say.

Of course, coño, be reasonable. Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ¿cómo estás? What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood. I'm on a date.

A date? Nice.

Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again. Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences in the cuts this time.

Over here-- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

And then over here-- clean.

Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Now, why would he do that?

He's experimenting.

He's trying to find the right way.

Is he experimenting with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits and took her f*cking head.

I don't find anyone around here.

And God only knows what he's doing with it.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

Will they catch him soon?

I doubt it.

The k*ller is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique... is incredible.

I'm sorry. I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm-- I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now?

And why can't I get that neat stack of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website, "scream-b*tch-scream"-- the mother of all r*pe sites.

That's it. He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time before he becomes a drop of blood in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, Dad.

I can explain.

You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge, you come to me, you tell me, and we deal with it together.

I do tell you, Dad.

The hell you do!

There's blood on this knife.

Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure? Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember anything from before, you know, before we took you in?

No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex. You are.

Otherwise, it would have been a lot worse than animals.

Okay? We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something to channel it.

Use it for good.

How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Terrible people. And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

You're saying they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course, you have to learn how to spot them, how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

Dad...

It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you, but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever-- you are my son, you are not alone, and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex. Help me out.

Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people. Throw her a f*cking raft.

But now we have a fourth body, and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story. The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime. You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust. I need a transfer to Homicide, bro, then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.

It certainly would sound better for the kids to say, "mommy's on Homicide."

Don't make me hit you.

Come on.

Then we could talk about more little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

What's wrong with that?

You sound like mom.

I just-- tell me what you know about cell crystallization.

What do you mean?

I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about that dead... headless chick.

You got that look in your eye.

I was there before you, and I noticed this body looked different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that? It's beautiful.

Dex. What are you thinking?

Sorry. That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

It's just a feeling.

That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys. They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way I can close a case is on my back.

I got to get out of Vice. Dex, please, you got to--

Refrigerated truck.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood, clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts? In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I covered all my tracks.

What do you care about that woman?

I don't. I was just--

You like when women cry? You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there, so flee.

Lieutenant, this f*cking guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for his spatter report on the cokehead murders-- Go do that.

It's okay. I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay. I'd like your input, and we'll discuss your case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

¿Encontráste algo?

Nada todavía.

Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.

Discúlpame.

You ready?

I'm gonna shame this b*tch.

Just state your case clean and easy. You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked down that witness?

Come on, people. Someone needs to find something here.

Lieutenant Laguerta?

Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.

I have an idea, something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

Cell crystallization.

Excuse me?

A little more confidence, please.

On the last victim, I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle that could cause that kind of tissue damage, a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be harder to catch, a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead.

That's very interesting, very creative.

Let's keep looking for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there. The forensic evidence, the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out there saw something, so let's concentrate on finding that person, okay?

But--

Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the f*ck was I supposed to say? The only reason I'm in here is because the captain said they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adiós to my career. I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way. Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter... My office, please.

What the hell?

What the f*ck?

Are you boning her?

No.

Oh, my god!

Deb, wait.

Shut up.

It had nothing to do with dr*gs.

L.T., this is a waste of our damn time.

I think sergeant Doakes is right.

I read the other reports, all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The m*rder*r came to k*ll the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady, and you don't do that unless you have a close, personal relationship with someone. Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but, sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, m*therf*cker.

Jaworski's been coming here for weeks-- likes to steal all the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards-- that's good.

f*ck!

Talk.

What do you mean?

I think you know what I mean.

No. Oh, god.

Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay. I did her.

How?

In a movie-- snuff film.

But I'm not sorry.

Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

Hello?

Hey. I'm-- I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm sorry about the other night, but... look, Dex, I really, really need to see you.

So can you-- can you come by later, you know, just for, like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really--

All right. What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all, it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet.

No way!

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

I'm all yours.

So all the ice trucks in Miami-- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

You never saw the driver?

Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird. Why would he keep it there?

I don't know, so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd. Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

You know, you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good-- you are.

Doakes picked up the k*ller in the cokehead murders.

You were right. It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter, how did you get to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out that report tomorrow?

Sure thing. You're tired.

Good night, lieutenant.

I'll catch you later.

Dex. It's been a while.

I'm sorry.

I was worried.

I didn't know what to do. I called in sick.

I mean...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. I was just--

I'm sorry. There was another... You know.

Look... The kids slept over next door.

Okay.

Would you like to come in?

Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Do you mind?

No.

It could be the kids.

Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right. I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

Tell me we're okay.

Better than.

Okay.

Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit, making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this, it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

No.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.Previously on "Dexter"...

You still don't remember anything from before?

You know, before we took you in?

No.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

Mama!

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio-dad.

And this is Rudy.

Dexter.

Hey.

I have waited a long time to meet you.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell's this guy thinking?

And the real king is still out there.

Hungry. Ready.

He'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think --

I'm falling for him.

Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

No!

f*cking whore!

Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday.

Can't be late Monday. Throws the whole week off.

What about breakfast?

Made and eaten.

And the kids' lunches?

Packed and ready to go.

Did you tell the locksmith?

Yeah, new locks on every door, reinforced strike plates, seven-pin keyways.

I want to talk to your mom for a sec.

Are you gonna make out?

None of your business.

Are you?

Astor.

Rita, you don't have to do this, you know.

Getting att*cked by your ex-husband merits a day off.

I'm fine.

I'm not gonna let Paul control my life anymore.

Those days are over.

It's gonna be okay. The police have been notified.

They'll find him.

What if they don't?

I got you some pepper spray.

Just aim for the eyes.

Hey, you want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

I had some at Kirk's birthday,

10 days ago.

See, you have lunch every day with your boyfriend, you miss a thing or two around here.

Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think.

It started out vanilla.

Guys, you should look at this.

Put that thing down, for God's sake.

It was addressed to Homicide.

Put it down!

Jesus, is that blood?

Morgan, get your a*s over here.

a*s en route.

You're the blood expert. What is this sh*t?

It's a little watery for jam.

Maybe you should open it.

What if there's an airborne toxin in here waiting to be released?

I got to wash my hands.

So gullible.

What is it?

Well, it's definitely blood.

Wait, there's something in here.

Marina View hotel.

It's a key.

May be some sort of promotional gag.

You know, stay the weekend, you get a jar of blood.

Show-and-tell's over.

Let's try and find out who sent this.

Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.

Batista's still working on the expl*si*n at the smack lab.

Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.

A jar of blood --

Dramatic, cryptic, playful.

Could it be him?

Got an extra key from the manager.

Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.

The guy who checked into 103

was white and normal looking.

I haven't seen a single security camera since we've been here.

It's likely this guy scouted hotels and chose one with lax security.

Better be ready to cancel your lunch.

Police. Open up.

Oh, my God. Jesus. Get back in your room.

Metro dispatch, this is 3-Henry-8-8

out at the Marina View hotel.

I need uniformed backup, forensics.

f*ck it. Just send everybody out.

It's been a while since we went prophylactic.

Not me. Last night, I met this chick --

I'll stop you right there, Vince.

So, they tell you anything about what's inside?

No one's been inside. Too much blood.

Dexter.

Just a heads-up -- It's bad in there.

Okay.

I'm serious.

Okay.

She's not kidding. It's your wet dream in there.

Okay.

You're going in first alone.

Get a sense of what we're dealing with and give me a report. Don't f*ck up.

Now I'm really curious.

He's been gone so long, he had to be planning a splashy return, but a crime scene just for me?

Mommy!

Tell me you found something, Morgan.

I talked to the guests in room 105.

They didn't see anyone go in or out.

What about across the hall?

German tourists. They got their head up their lederhosen.

They said they heard a whirring sound but thought someone was mixing margaritas or vacuuming.

Oh, my god!

Hey. Hey, you okay?

I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there.

Never should have skipped breakfast.

Bullshit. You're shaking. What the hell happened up there?

No, I'm okay. I just need a little air.

Something finally got to you.

I guess you're human after all.

Cut him some slack, all right?

I hate to disappoint you, I think it's just low blood sugar.

Tell us what you saw, Dex.

How many dead?

A lot.

But no bodies, just blood --

50, 60 liters.

Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know.

You're saying there was a mass m*rder in there, but they took the bodies?

How is that possible?

There's one elevator, emergency stairs with alarms.

Someone would have seen corpses coming out.

I don't f*cking know.

Hey, Dexter, you all right?

I can't go back in there.

You don't have to.

Fine.

Just get yourself cleaned up and --

I don't know -- Work from the hallway or something.

You're in room 422.

Elevators are to your right, and Bobby will see to your bags.

Dade county sheriff's department.

I'm looking for Rita Bennett.

That's me. Did you find Paul?

I'm sorry?

Paul Bennett.

My ex-husband att*cked me last night.

My boyfriend filed a police report.

The only report we have is the one that Mr. Bennett filed.

What? Wait.

Paul filed a police report? For what?

as*ault. Your ex-husband was just released from Baptist Memorial hospital.

He's pressing charges against you.

He att*cked me!

Not according to him.

All right. Can we talk about this later?

We need a formal statement.

You're gonna have to come with us right now to the station.

Fine.

Hey, make sure you label the section of the grid each blood sample came from. All right?

Sweet.

You should really get in here, Dex.

I never seen anything like this.

Wait till you've seen a few more Columbian drug busts.

Dude, I got misting up the walls, across the ceiling, but no tissue. Come see.

Photos, Vince.

Hey, and how come the blood's not clotting?

The blood's not clotting?

No.

Genuine medical mystery.

Just keep getting samples.

I'll test it at the lab.

Hello? Don't hang up.

Dexter, I'm at the sheriff's station.

Paul's pressing as*ault charges against me.

How's it even possible? I was defending myself.

Just stay calm. I know a lawyer.

I'll straighten it out.

I am calm.

They're the hysterical ones.

They're charging me with a class-2 felony.

Hello, Dexter? Are you there?

Yeah, I'm right here.

This is ridiculous.

I could lose my job. I could lose my kids.

I won't let that happen.

Well, I'm glad you're so confident.

Rita, just trust me.

I know how the system works.

Look, I'm at a crime scene right now, and I have to go, but I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.

You okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

Thank you.

Yeah, bye.

Is there a wall socket in there? Check it out.

What? A wall socket?

Yeah.

Of course there's a wall socket. There's lots of wall --

Hey, you're right.

There was something plugged in here -- probably a power tool to cut them up.

Come take a look.

Photos, Vince.

Lots and lots of photos.

Open Sesame.

Blood samples for the fridge.

And you better make room. There's a lot more coming.

sh**t at the Bel Canto tonight. You in?

I'm not in the mood.

Angel, you're on the market, and the Bel Canto is hottie central.

Look at this.

They were for Nina's birthday -- backstage passes to Neil Diamond.

You're in worse shape than I thought.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

Oh, Masuka was looking for you.

Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.

Yeah, I told him I had a yeast infection.

A bit of an overshare.

You want to talk about what happened today?

Already did.

Dexter, the last time I saw you like that was when dad died.

Can talk to me, you know?

Just got to open your mouth and move it.

I'll call Rudy. I'll tell him I'll be late.

Deb, seriously.

I puked.

I'm fine.

I know you want to help, but unless you have breath mints, there's nothing to do.

Why do you always do this?

Do what?

You shut me out!

Like your birth father that lived up the highway your whole life and never tried to contact you.

I still don't know how that makes you feel.

I'll tell you what, if some random emotion strikes me in the middle of the night, you'll be the first one I call.

Fine.

Whatever.

Did Paul force his way into the house?

No.

Did you ask him to leave?

Yes, and he refused.

But in your statement, it says you invited your ex-husband into your bedroom.

He was drunk, and the kids were asleep, and I knew exactly where this was heading --

Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

And you didn't want it to escalate. I understand that, but we can't prove intent.

Your ex-husband has the injuries here, not you.

Paul has a record of spousal abuse.

Spousal abuse can be mutual.

It was never mutual.

Okay.

But the man is a model parolee.

His drug tests are clean.

He's got glowing reports from the court-appointed supervisor.

Corrections will want to see this guy transition.

I don't care!

He's not going near my children. Do you understand?

Rita, if you deny him visitation, you could lose your children.

Now, you have deposition in two days.

Do not give this man any more amm*nit*on than he already has.

Okay.

Damn.

Just blood?

What happened to the bodies?

Hell if I know.

I don't want to know.

Blood was bad enough.

No wonder you seem so amped.

Your brother must have loved it.

f*ck no. He freaked.

Really?

I thought, you know, blood was his thing.

What happened?

I don' know. It was like usual. He shut me out.

Did he say anything?

Let's not talk about Dex right now.

Was it like a panic attack?

I don't know.

He's not really big into sharing his feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.

Kiss me.

What's the matter? You don't even have wood.

Well, you're the one that said you wanted to talk.

Yeah, but not now. I'm horny.

Maybe I should call him.

Are you f*cking kidding me?

What? We -- We bonded last weekend.

Isn't that what boyfriends are supposed to do, show some interest in the family?

Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's trying to get into his pants.

Deb, that's not fair.

You take me out on a -- couples' weekend to get to know your brother, and then you punish me for giving a damn?

I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.

You know what?

Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.

Okay. I'm gonna go watch  TV.

She loved him so g*dd*mn much.

She took every one of his CDs in the separation.

She wouldn't even give me his Greatest Hits.

Nina loved Neil Diamond. "Song Sung Blue." "September Morn."

Oh, my god -- "Kentucky Woman."

You got to love that sh*t.

That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.

Waitress! Is there a waitress?

I need a drink. Waitress!

Bro, you're a train wreck.

Look, you got to stop talking about the divorce.

I ain't ashamed.

Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.

Look...

Don't talk about the divorce unless they ask.

Comprendo?

Eighty-six the ring.

I have to take a squirt.

She's gonna f*ck me silly.

My sister's right. I don't share my problems with her...

Or with anybody.

Harry taught me that -- Secrecy, self-reliance, and a well-stocked cupboard of hefty bags.

Fortunately, I've never met a problem I can't manage...

Until that boy in the blood.

He scares me. I want him to go away.

You awake?

What?

Are you sure you locked the door?

Yeah, I'm positive -- Bolt and chain.

What am I gonna do?

Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

And I will.

I can always see other people's problems more clearly than my own.

Fortunately, Rita's has a name.

Everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet in room 103

left a footprint, and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel, that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for --

The k*ller's.

This shows everywhere he went in the room.

The question is why.

Hold on.

Aren't we missing something?

Where are the victims' footprints?

Give that lady a lollipop.

Are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103?

Why would a guy stage a m*ssacre and not have any bodies?

And where'd he get the blood?

I've just got a preliminary blood report.

The blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies, possibly more.

My fellow traveler had five victims.

Ice-truck k*ller had 5 victims.

5 bloodless victims.

I always wondered what he did with the blood.

Wait, wait.

The ice-truck k*ller did not horde his victims' blood just to have a party at the m*therf*cking Marina View hotel.

Why would he do that?

To chase me down the rabbit hole.

What was that, Morgan?

I didn't say anything.

I'll remind you people --

We arrested the ice-truck k*ller.

His name is Neil Perry, and he's awaiting trial in county.

Bullshit.

Neil Perry recanted his confession. He's a fraud.

Try telling that to the capital.

I did.

Do we have any more evidence to support this theory?

When Masuka noticed the blood wasn't clotting, I ran some tests, and it was loaded with Coumadin and heparin.

One's an anticoagulant. The other's a preservative.

It means the blood's old.

Plus the blood spatters'

all impact and castoff.

There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

Masuka, run the DNA on all five vics and see if it matches the ice-truck k*ller's victims.

You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

Retrace his steps.

Maybe it'll tell us something.

And not a word to anyone about the ice-truck k*ller.

All right, Astor, just stand up straight.

Now, do you have the emergency phone number list?

It's in my backpack. Do I have to show it to you again?

Just promise me you won't let your brother out of your sight.

Rita?

You're scaring them.

Yeah, well, they should be.

I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

What'd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors'?

I smelled gas.

I should have just thrown them in the car and headed out of state, gone back to Michigan.

Remember what the lawyer said.

You don't want to do anything rash.

Just relax. The court supervisor will be there the whole time.

Hey, buddy. Come on. Where's the love? Come on.

Daddy, what happened?

Oh, nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head. That's it.

Hey, we're going to the circus.

We're going to the circus, 'cause daddy always keeps his promises, remember?

Good.

All right. Ready?

Got your stuff?

Let's go.

You okay?

I prefer the enchanting Rita over the worried one.

If I can figure out a way to make her ex-husband my problem, I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

All I need is a little proof of his inner monster.

Harry would have insisted on that.

Harry didn't believe in preemptive k*lling, but maybe I can bend the rules just this once.

After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

He lied about my birth father.

The trifecta -- w*apon, a*mo, and impaired judgment.

Throw in a little domestic v*olence, and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter.

Mommy!

Hide your head, Dexter.

Close your eyes.

No!

So, after he soaked the room in blood, he crossed to the desk...

And then over to the bedside table.

There's a clock radio and some smeared blood.

Maybe he turned it on.

No, we're missing something. Let's go over it again.

We've been over it three times!

Well, maybe the map's wrong.

Call your brother.

What?

Why is everybody's first move to call Dexter?

You don't even like him.

What'd the freak do this time, boil your goldfish?

No, it's just...

It's Rudy.

We had our first fight.

Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

I thought we were talking about your brother.

We were.

And we'll be back with Billy Joel, the Eurythmics, and Devo on 103 fm, hits from the '80s.

Turn that off.

No, wait. I want to hear it.

It's Devo. Turn that sh*t off.

He said 103 fm. This is room 103.

Leviticus 10:3.

10:3 -- 103.

Son of a b*tch.

You think he's trying to tell us something? "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, "and before all people, "I will be glorified."

Hey.

Hey.

Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

So you came here?

You know you know her better than anyone.

Come on. I got two porterhouses and a sixer of microbrew.

Well, one minute we're talking about her day, you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

Right.

And the next, she wants to... jump my bones.

I mean, Deb's hot and all, but sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while, you know?

She's my sister. I don't know.

Can I help you find something?

You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife.

Thanks.

Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.

Me?

Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.

So, what do I do?

Tell her it's all your fault.

Seriously?

You will eventually.

Deb has a way of wearing you down.

Just start from there. It's easier.

I got to take this. You mind if I...?

Hey. Where are you?

Still at work, chasing a lead.

Let me guess --

The bloodbath case.

I don't want to talk shop right now.

Baby, I am so sorry.

You were totally right.

I was mad at Dexter, and I took it out on you.

My shift's almost done. You want to come over and talk?

I'd love to, babe, but I'm about to eat dinner with Dexter.

Well, after.

Yeah, but here's the thing.

I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

I mean, it's closer, and I'm drinking, you know.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Care to dance?

You dance to this?

A bit.

What about your wife?

Tan line on your ring finger.

Well, um...

I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

Divorced? I get it.

Mine was just finalized.

Let's go.

Will you excuse me?

Excuse me.

Police. I need to talk to you.

I'm not a hooker anymore.

I work for a legitimate escort service now.

I'm not here to bust anyone.

I just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do.

He was a real good client.

You want to spend the night in a cell?

All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

Guy or client?

A john, okay?

That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

Anyway, he started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He started doing some kinky, weird stuff, like he was worshipping it.

To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

I liked it, so I kept doing it.

You know that guy on the news they arrested for the ice-truck killings?

Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

Is that the guy?

No way.

My trick, he's sexy.

A freak, but sexy.

Okay.

From the beginning and with more detail.

Well, thanks for the hospitality.

Hey, thanks for the steaks.

You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

Deb mentioned that you had a little -- incident at the crime scene.

Did she?

Well, most of my prosthetic clients are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me.

Anyway, I'm a good listener if you ever want to talk.

Thanks, but unless you know an expert in -- repressed memories...

For real?

You know something about it?

More than I ever wanted to.

When I was in high school, I started having these dreams of a woman hit by a truck.

Who was she?

I didn't know.

Then one day I stopped by a mailbox, and it all came crashing back...

My mom getting out to mail a letter, me still in the car.

I watched her die.

How old were you?

4.

I didn't remember anything till I -- went and mailed a letter.

Walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it.

What kind of memories are you having?

They're still a little vague.

Right.

Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

Maybe next time.

When you see Deb, go with white roses.

They're her favorite.

That's a good tip.

It's funny how life brings people together, huh?

Rudy misunderstands my problem.

I want the boy and blood to go away, not come crashing back.

Fortunately, I have other people's problems to focus on right now.

Like forgotten cellphones.

What do you got?

Well, so far we're chasing a ghost.

Couple of employees helped with the sketch, but it's pretty generic.

Only real lead we have is a couple of numbers he set at the crime scene.

Screw the numbers.

Who was k*lled? Where are the bodies?

I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

Just theories.

We're still waiting for full blood results.

Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

Well, you got to give me something and soon.

This department can't afford another public relations disaster.

Well...

Maybe you should tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry go.

He's not the ice-truck k*ller.

Are you still hung up -- I can't believe this.

Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

The D.A. takes his cues from us.

If you just tell him you made a mistake...

Not going to happen. Now let it go.

First break in this case, you come straight to me.

This may be a shot in the dark, but I met this hooker last night.

Going with a pro -- Now, that's how you get over the ex.

No, that's not what I mean.

So you didn't f*ck her. But she blew you, right?

Would you shut up?

It was a lead.

On what?

I'll let you know if it pans out, but what do you know about amputee fetishes?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's... it's called acrotomophilia.

But don't let them hear you call it that.

It sounds like a disease.

No, they prefer to be known as "devotees."

I knew you were the man to ask.

Not really.

I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

You know who you should talk to?

It's... What's his face -- Deb's boyfriend.

Prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time.

Thanks.

No memory flashes here.

No little lost boy in blood.

Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex.

Here's to hoping.

Yo, Dex.

Hey.

So, this is what you do for a living?

I'm trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene.

A power tool was used.

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Circular saw.

Seems like there'd be an easier way to make a mess like this.

Yeah, trust me. I know. I've been in here for hours.

You know, in my line of work, you hear all sorts of horror stories -- boat propellers, garbage disposals.

It seems like something you'd see with a chainsaw.

Yeah, I hear that.

But this power tool was plugged into a socket.

Guess you haven't heard of an electric chainsaw.

Come on, people. We're coming up empty.

Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

We need to find the connection, and until we do, you need to go over every page of every police report you wrote in the last six months.

Think.

1-0-3. 103.

Bus station locker, piece of a bank account, area code, partial license plate.

What is it? I want answers.

What are you doing here?

How do you always do it?

Do what?

Make me feel like I'm 6

years old all the time.

If this is about Rudy, he was just picking up his cellphone.

Where'd he leave it?

My apartment.

What was he doing there?

Uh... eating steaks.

And?

Uh... I don't know. Drinking beer.

And?

Debra.

And?

Talking?

Talking.

You talked.

You opened your mouth, and sounds came out.

On the same night that I wanted to talk to you, but you shut me out.

Oh.

Yeah, "oh."

You don't talk to me, Dex.

You've spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance.

But my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones --

They were porterhouses.

Porterhouses, and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night.

Dex, you are all the family that I have, and I barely know you.

So, if you're gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day, if somebody's gonna break through your f*cking walls, I think it should be me.

I think I have earned it.

I'm late for Rita's deposition.

Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

You Rudy Cooper?

Angel Batista.

I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

Sure.

Let me just grab the door.

So, does this have to do with a case?

You could say that.

Well, fire away.

Well, I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand --

Call girl, actually.

Said she had a very unique client, an amputee devotee.

You have a lead on this client?

That's the b*tch of it.

I don't have a goddamned clue, except for the freaky sex stuff.

I was hoping that you could steer me toward some of those weirdos.

I'm afraid I got into this business to help people get better, not help people get off.

Yeah, I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

But I can talk to some of my colleagues, see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

That'd be great.

How often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy, huh?

You in a rush for this information?

No, no, I'm good. I'm chasing a long shot, really.

Well, just... give me a call at the station when you got something.

Will do.

Good to meet you.

Good to meet you.

Last question.

According to your ex-husband, you left town with your boyfriend last weekend.

That's right. His father died.

Did your ex-husband have a scheduled visitation with his children during that time?

I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

So, then he gave you permission?

No.

I'm the one that gave him visitation in the first place.

I'm the custodial parent. I didn't have to do that.

Could you give us a second?

Yes, of course.

Why didn't you tell me you broke your visitation agreement?

I didn't know it was a big deal.

I think she's answered that last question, so unless there's something else...

No, that's fine.

If I missed anything, we'll get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

Nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation.

It's mandatory in these cases.

The psych test determines if there's a competency hearing.

For me?

But he's the ex-con.

It's standard. Rita, you should be fine.

Should be?

You mean she could actually lose this?

Guys...

I'm handcuffed here.

You violated a custody agreement.

You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

He has a case.

Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

So, how much candy have you had?

Lots.

Thanks.

Now she'll never get to sleep.

She'll calm down soon.

This one's already crashed.

Mom, can my dad read me a story?

I don't think so, honey.

Please?

Okay.

But just one.

Put your duds on, buddy --

Spider-man ones I bought you.

I'll get him ready. You've got 20 minutes left.

Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

Hey, Rita.

It doesn't have to be this way.

I mean, we can make this easier on each other, right?

I could drop the charges if you agree to unsupervised visitation.

f*ck you.

Hey, Dexy.

You know, I don't think your girlfriend appreciates the gravity of the situation.

If she loses that case, she could lose the kids.

That won't happen.

Never say "won't."

We live in a world of wills --

Wills and wonders.

That's what I'm trying to teach my children.

And they are my children, too, something she seems to forget.

Okay, so I made some mistakes, but I learned from it, right?

Hey, I'm sober.

Look. No needle marks.

I got the f*cking Alaskan pipeline running through these veins, and all because of those -- two little s of love in the next room.

My heart beats for those two kids, so if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt --

Harry's first rule was don't get emotionally involved.

I think this is why.

Astor, go brush your teeth.

Someone once said it's easier dealing with other people's problems than your own.

They were wrong.

Paul?

Dexter?

Where were you?

Taking out the trash.

Did you see Paul?

When I was in the side yard, I heard the front door open.

Hey, my dad's car is gone.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

The ice-truck k*ller case has been reopened.

Officially.

We have new forensic evidence that shows that the DNA from the blood at the Marina View hotel matches the DNA from his victims.

What about Neil Perry?

Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck k*ller?

All those questions should be directed to captain Matthews.

He's been personally handling the Perry case.

Oh, sh*t.

I hope she told the Captain.

Who knew?

Who knew about this?

This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

The ice-truck k*ller is still at large.

Sure.

I'll call you back.

You overplayed your hand, Maria.

I gave you a chance to make it right.

I told you --

You don't tell me sh*t!

This is my department.

I made you lieutenant. Me.

You were just another spik detective.

Nice, Tom. Real nice.

Your true colors finally come out.

Oh, no.

No, you haven't seen my true colors, Maria.

But you're about to.

Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

Thank you.

Dexter.

What happened? What's wrong?

It's Paul.

I don't know all the details, but he -- violated Florida's three strikes law.

He's back in jail.

It is truly amazing the things you can do when you put your mind to it.

What's so funny, mom?

Yeah, why are you laughing?

No problem is insurmountable.

Not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in Miami.

Paul did need to go away.

This is the police.

Sir, you're going to have to turn down the television.

- But death wasn't the answer.

Police. Open up.

We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

- Life in prison will do just fine.

For now, at least, the code of Harry remains... unbroken.

Hey, get over here.

You're part of this family, too.

I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

Stay with us.

Hang in there, okay? Keep looking at us.

Heard they're dropping ice-truck m*rder charges on Neil Perry.

Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing a lawsuit any minute now.

More sh*t for us to deal with.

Speaking of which, watch out for reporters out there.

They're still waiting on a comment from the Captain.

So, things still rocky at home?

Oh, with Rudy?

Yeah.

I'm not calling until he apologizes.

I'm done being second choice.

Good for you, Morgan.

If you're not doing anything tonight, Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

For you.

It's too late. You blew it.

I did blow it. This is the first chance I've had to talk.

I'm too tired to talk.

Well... let's go home, fall into bed.

Why, Rudy?

I mean, f*cking why?

You didn't want to fall into bed the other night when I laid my heart out on the phone.

You wanted to talk to my brother.

I was confused.

Well, I'm not confused. That's the problem, I know what I want.

I was confused because I love you.

What I want is very simple and uncomplicated.

What did you say?

I love you.

Don't try to...

f*ck.

What?

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

I'm just, uh... incident with a tool at the workshop.

Well, let's get you home and take care of it.

So, this is doom.

I've been the architect of so much of it.

It's only fair I should know what all the fuss is all about.

He left me this room for a reason.

Five women gave their blood, their lives for this moment.

There's only one way to find out why.

Close your eyes, Dexter.

I want mama.

No! Not in front of my baby!

Oh, god. Please don't cry.

It's gonna be okay.

Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

No!

Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

Dexter. Close your eyes.

I want mama!

I want mama!

Mommy loves you, Dexter.

Previously on "Dexter"...

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

It's time for you to go away.

It's Paul. He...

He violated Florida's three-strikes law.

The cops picked him up totally strung out on heroin.

He's back in jail.

Holy sh*t! They're f*cking fingertips.

He started getting all rough with me until he saw this.

Then what?

Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

Told me to take my fake hand off.

He takes all my nail polish and paints each nail a different color.

Menthol?

Like cough drops.

I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he...

Son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

I was confused because I love you.

What did you say?

I love you.

I love you, too.

What happened to your lip?

No, it's -- I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.

I need an ambulance at

1228 Calendar Street.

A guy's been stabbed.

I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.

The same images running through my head over and over.

I was there.

I saw my mother's death.

A buried memory, forgotten all these years.

It climbed inside me that day.

And it's been with me ever since --

My dark passenger.

You should be focusing on me, socio.

Seriously want to get the m*therf*cker that did this to Batista.

I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.

How's he doing? Do we know?

Still in surgery.

Laguerta's there.

God, I hate feeling so helpless.

What, no jokes about providing gross sexual comfort in a time of crisis?

Our friend was stabbed...

And he might die.

Officer Morgan.

What do you think, Dex?

He put up a fight. There was a struggle.

Attaboy, Angel.

Here, this trail --

Steady stream of drops.

He had a few seconds. Tried to move away until -- till he fell.

So much blood.

What's happening to me?

No way.

You're the one I'm supposed to meet.

In the flesh.

You know, I was just talking to someone about you.

That tickles.

Don't stop.

I wouldn't dream of stopping.

You're so different this time --

Gentle.

Are you gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again?

Actually, your...

...imperfection is what saved you the first time.

Saved me from what?

True artistry.

The message of my work is -- not in the product itself, but rather the presentation.

That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.

It's quite unsightly, actually.

Hey, you don't have to be an as*h*le about it.

Hey, hey, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to offend.

Truthfully...

I'm thankful for you.

You're my escape plan.

Escape from what?

The police.

Because of you, I've had to speed up my... project.

I need something to distract them by.

And I always found a freshly chopped-up body always does the trick.

Wait, wait! No!

Don't struggle.

That never helps.

I'm compressing your carotid artery, and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.

In about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.

Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.

Okay, I guess you went to bed.

Or you fell asleep on the couch watching "Xena" reruns, which I still think makes you a dork.

Either way, call me when you get this, okay?

Miss you.

He's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.

So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.

No. I mean, I can't.

Alright. I understand.

You need to be there for your friend.

I haven't told the kids yet.

Told them about Angel?

No, about Paul...

Being back in prison?

I hate breaking their hearts. They think so much of their dad now.

Right.

You know what?

Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.

Thanks.

They're actually coming out right now. I got to go.

Angel sustained severe internal injuries.

He lost a lot of blood.

But... the surgery was successful.

It looks like our boy's out of the woods.

I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.

But I can't focus.

I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

I need to know what it means.

Morgan.

What the f*ck is wrong with you?

I have someplace I have to be.

Well, we all got someplace to be.

But you just found out that somebody who was supposed to be your friend is gonna live.

Does that make you feel anything?

Anything at all?

Take your f*cking hand off me.

Just what I always thought.

Right.

♪ Deck the halls with parts of bodies ♪

♪ La-da-da-da dum ♪

sh*t. Just what I need.

Hey.

I know it's late.

I guess you didn't get my message.

I drove by and saw your car.

I can go.

Get your a*s in here.

It's about time you see where I live anyway.

You have no idea how much I needed this.

You feel good.

And cold. You're freezing!

Well, then stay and keep me warm.

This Batista thing has gotten to you, hasn't it?

Angel's daughter was there.

That's got to be rough.

Daughter of a cop --

Just like you.

Yeah.

I remember what that's like --

Kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.

Let's get out of town for the weekend --

Just the two of us.

We need to talk.

I'm sitting right here.

Nope.

The time has got to be right.

Okay.

It'll have to wait...

At least till we catch the as*h*le who did this to Batista.

Let me warn you -- I can be very persistent.

I need to get out of town, and I need you... to come... with me.

What I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.

I'm totally wired from all this sh*t.

Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.

My loving arms.

And...

I got a little thing to help you sleep.

That ain't no little thing.

I meant Valium.

It's one of the perks working at the hospital.

Wine and Valium?

I'll be totally helpless.

You read my mind.

Well, as I live and breathe!

You miss me?

You and the bear claws you're hiding behind your back.

This must be important.

Haven't seen much of you lately.

No rest for the wicked.

How's Gene?

Good days and bad.

He just finished his first round of radiation.

Well, he's a good guy.

Not much of a bridge player, though.

Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and I would take them to the cleaners.

I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.

Well, sure thing.

Got a date?

Not exactly.

It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

I wish I could help, but... everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basement at City Hall.

And... as you can see, I'm up to my you-know-what in year-end reports, so...

It's my lieutenant.

Camilla, is there anything you remember?

What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his home and give you a loving family.

I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.

Who found the body parts?

I did.

They were left under the tree.

I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around...

Till I found the head.

I told him not to touch anything, but he never listens.

God, Patty, you're such a b*tch.

Did you guys see anything out of the ordinary before you found the body?

There were some broken ornaments by the tree.

Who could do something like this so close to Christmas?

The Grinch.

Oh, you're a f*cking riot, Max!

Like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this.

There go our jobs.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Oh, sucks to be an elf.

...Get some visual surveillance.

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim. Cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

Yep. And after the bloodbath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the press on this one.

James!

Yeah?

I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.

And will somebody turn off this g*dd*mn snow machine?!

Your sister can help you out.

That a whole sexual-tension thing or am I missing something?

103.

It's the same numbers he left at Marina View hotel.

Any leads as to what they mean?

We've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers

-- Nothing.

They need more to go on.

First he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.

Now he leaves me this --

A calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.

It doesn't make sense.

Crime scene's wiped clean.

Another hooker?

Ho, ho, ho -- Another dead ho.

Somebody's been naughty.

Hey, Morgan.

Want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for Christmas?

And he's back!

No, thanks.

Last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.

This doesn't seem right.

Body parts scattered among the presents.

Broken ornaments.

It's not his usual meticulous style.

It seems rushed...

Haphazard.

That would explain why we can't find one of the hands.

What's wrong?

There's something underneath the torso.

Merry Christmas, Miami.

After all this time, why do you think the ice-truck k*ller has struck again?

Any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.

Do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?

Sir? "You've arrested the wrong man. "Made the world think I'm a rank amateur, "and I'm very, very angry "to answer for your mistakes."

Stop the tape.

What are you doing?

Look at her tears. They're rolling up.

Oh, my God.

Bastard's got her upside down.

That's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat.

Please. No, please, no --

All right, turn it off.

I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.

Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

With all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in charge of this investigation.

Not anymore.

The fact is we haven't been able to catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

We've got to come up with some fresh ideas.

This is some bullshit. I'll go talk to him.

No, no, no. Do as he says.

The commissioner has his a*s in a sling.

He's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.

So you're just gonna sit back and take this?

Well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...

I'll be at the hospital.

All right, P.B. and J. inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.

Tastes better that way.

Has dad said if he's coming over Christmas eve or Christmas morning?

I miss him.

Well, I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.

Where is he?

Well, uh...he's --

He's back in jail, isn't he?

Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.

He loves you guys so much.

I forgot my math book.

I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

We could write him a letter.

It's all your fault.

You could at least pretend you want to be here.

You're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.

Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

He's been acting weird lately.

Last night he said we need to talk.

Well, that's never good.

Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

I've only been obsessing about this all day.

Think you could talk to him for me?

Look, it's Rudy.

I sort of called him.

Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

Oh, sh*t.

That's work. I have to go.

Here, take mine. Sorry.

What's with your lip?

Deb catch you with a right hook?

She can be pretty protective with the remote.

I had a little... workshop accident this morning.

Doesn't look like it happened this morning.

The cut's already closing up.

Did I say-- I meant yesterday morning.

I think I'm working too hard.

Anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

My sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.

Your sister's wrong.

So this whole "need to talk" thing?

I'm starting to look at the big picture.

She's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?

No, I don't know.

But I do know that Deb's falling for you...

Hard.

You hurt her...

And you'll hurt me.

Something like that.

Angel, se recupera.

Angel va a estar en la casa para la Navidad.

Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

Y además...

I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

Hey, you.

You had us so worried.

If I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me, I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

I'm gonna get the doctor.

No, no, no. What are you doing?

No, dejalo.

The doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.

That's why I got two, right?

It's a good thing you decided to be a cop.

Tell me that you caught the c*cksucker that ruined one of my best shirts.

We don't have any leads.

Did you see anything?

No.

He was behind me.

I just felt the blade go in.

It happened so fast.

Maria...

How long has Nina been here?

She was the first one at the hospital.

She's been with you the whole time.

Yo no sé porque, pero...

My mother was m*rder*d before my eyes.

Makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.

The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.

I need to know more details.

I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.

You should see this.

That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?

This drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the rest of Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- On the inside of the back collar.

Angel is stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

Well, run the DNA.

If this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.

Already sent a sample to the lab.

All right, let's get this together. Come on, let's go.

Sorry to hear... You know, about Matthews taking you off the case.

Last gasp of a desperate man.

Things are gonna change around here.

And I won't forget your help. "And I'm very, very angry." "Oh, God, no! No, please!"

I can't watch this again.

I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.

Wait -- What was that?

The camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.

Watch.

That, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.

He needs it cold to preserve the bodies. We knew that.

But check this out.

Look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.

This room is way bigger than your standard commercial freezer.

Most likely it was a custom build.

So we should focus our search on commercial districts.

No.

Residential.

You think he built this in his own place?

He picks up hookers, right?

I worked Vice.

The smart girls know not to go near a factory or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again.

How do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?

None of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.

Besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?

The escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

And her body was found at Santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.

We'll map out grids.

We'll focus on private residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.

We catch a break...

We'll catch this son of a b*tch.

Wait! Where the hell are you going?

I need to do some research on a case.

You were supposed to call me after your lunch with Rudy.

I've been freaking out!

He sent me this text message. "Cum sail away with me?"

He misspelled "come."

Dexter.

This is no time to joke.

This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

What did he say to you?

Oh, wait, no. Don't.

Don't tell me.

Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

Unless I should know. Should I know?

Okay.

Tell me.

You know, no. Don't. "We need to talk"?

Who says that unless you're getting dumped?

I don't think that's what this is about.

He probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.

You know, I always do this.

I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

He wants to be part of the family.

What?

Wait.

Like...

Propose?

I have to get to the library before it closes, but we'll talk about this later, okay?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.

No details --

Just a blur of images rushing by.

But my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.

So do I.

This is it for the Metro News for 1972 through 1973.

The Tribune's archives...

10/3?

1-0-3 -- Same as the hotel, same as Santa's cottage.

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Close your eyes.

Don't look.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

No wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.

If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel... this.

October 3, 1973.

Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

You've been busy.

A crime that big and yet there's no record of the case file at City Hall, that seems a bit odd. Don't you think?

It's a long time ago.

What is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!

Why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!

Camilla...

Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

I can't give you the file 'cause it no longer exists.

I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.

You did what?

Made a promise to your father.

Why, to protect him?

To protect you.

Harry had a code.

He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

You were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.

Yeah!

Dex! Cody's run away!

Are you sure?

Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

Well, call the police. I'll be right there.

Okay.

Camilla...

I need to know the truth.

Kid...

Leave this one alone.

I can't sit here like this.

I should be out there doing something.

Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case Cody comes home.

The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

What if some crazy person picked him up off the street?

It's all my fault.

Honey, what are you talking about?

I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

I'm his big sister.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

It's not your fault, okay?

Okay?

Could you go get Dexter some water?

God.

I should have seen this coming.

Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.

Paul.

Today's Thursday, right?

Yeah.

I think I know where Cody might be.

Hey.

Need a push?

Today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?

He'll be here.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back -- not for a long time.

Look, we'll talk about this when we get home, okay?

After all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.

He won't even look at me.

I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.

Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

About their father.

I told them Paul was back in jail.

Well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them who he is. He's still the same -- drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.

They should hear that.

You're not a parent. You don't understand.

You do anything to protect your kids.

Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them.

You're protecting Paul.

Well, I -- I got to get them home.

Somebody's in a good mood.

The commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.

They've been in Matthews'

office for two hours.

You thinking his a*s is about three shades of red right now?

I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.

Tell me that did not just happen.

It's who you know and who you blow.

Probably picking their f*cking tee time.

Maria, watch your back.

He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.

Let him try.

My man Juan, hook it up.

They didn't have "Road and Track" so...

That better be a bag of applesauce.

Okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.

You got to be kidding me!

Two double-meats?

A man's got to eat.

You're so cute when you're annoyed.

You know, your mouth makes those little O's.

God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm being f*cking cute with you?

Well, not now you don't, no.

Why do you always do this -- make light of things that matter?

Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

When I come home, I'll eat anything you want.

No jokes, no complaining -- I promise.

When you come home?

I thought the way things are going with us...

I thought you'd forgiven me.

Well, of course I forgive you.

I forgave you a long time ago.

Okay, so let's fix this.

This could be a second chance for us.

What?

Look, you did what you did.

It was hard.

But it got us to face the truth.

We were miserable... for years.

Do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?

Maybe.

What if I do?

Look, you will always be Jorge's father.

I will always care about you.

I'll always be here for you.

But our marriage is over.

Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

Maria...

Let's you and me have a talk.

Congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.

You must be thrilled.

But now, if you don't mind --

Let me get right to the point.

All our mishaps these last few months --

Failure to bring in the ice-truck k*ller, mishandling of Tony Tucci...

Even Neil Perry --

Neil Perry was your f*ck-up...

Not mine.

They're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.

Well...

I'm glad to hear you say that.

Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

So this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

Please, it's ridiculous.

You really don't want to do this.

Because of your status in the Cuban community?

I'm a f*cking hero to this community!

You think they're just gonna accept it?

Your replacement has already been selected.

Her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale --

A real up-and-comer.

Pascal, the Haitian-American?

The one who got shot last year in the line of duty.

Turns out she's an actual hero.

You think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.

I did warn you, Maria.

I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.

Expect a call from my union rep.

You want it, you'll always have a place in the bullpen --

And my f*cking lawyer, too!

...with all the other detectives.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

You g*dd*mn... son of a b*tch!

Oh, you got to be kidding me.

How are you?

How the hell do I look?

I can barely remember how I got here.

Look, there's something we need to discuss.

If you came for an apology, you wasted a t*nk of gas.

Sit. I'm not finished.

f*ck you.

Astor and Cody are in the other room.

Jesus, you brought them here?

Look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place!

Fine.

Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

You will never see your kids again.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.

I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor.

If they see me here like this, I'm gonna lose them forever.

Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.

And I know you love them.

But if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.

Now, you cheated on me.

You broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

But I am giving you the chance to make it all right.

But not for me, for them.

I... wouldn't know what to say.

Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

It's a valuable lesson.

It's one you never got.

So what's it gonna be?

Okay.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Hey!

All right, this won't take long.

There was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to check the back of your head.

Just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.

How are things with you and Rita?

Not so good, actually. We kind of... had words. I think I really upset her.

That's rough, man.

Maybe I'm not the right person for her.

Some people are meant to be alone, right?

Dex, socio, alone sucks.

Hijo de puta!

Sorry.

Teeth marks.

You definitely wounded this guy.

Good.

I hope I broke his f*cking nose...

Or at least gave him a fat lip.

Angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.

Nice guy.

Why?

At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.

He was lying, and I was too distracted to care.

But he's got my full attention now.

Hey, you here tonight?

Yeah, we're tits-deep in the ice-truck k*ller.

Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.

So that text message you got from Rudy about going away with him -- you're not gonna do that?

Tragically, no.

I was all psyched to meet him at the Miami Beach marina but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

Good.

Good?

I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't -- Why is that good?

No, I meant good that you're making progress here.

Yeah. We're getting closer.

Fingers crossed.

At least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.

We've defined the area for the residential search.

Good.

So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the --

That him?

Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you got that stupid-a*s grin on your face again.

Go ahead. Answer it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, Supercop.

What's the word?

I'm kind of in a thing right now.

Got it. I'll be quick.

You never answered my text.

Do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?

Yeah, about that --

Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

I know, I know. It's just --

We've had a major break in the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I promise, as soon as we catch this douchebag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.

You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

Okay, okay but --

How about dinner?

Oh, my God, you are persistent.

Well, you got to eat, right?

So why not eat dinner with me... on this yacht I'm on?

Where the hell did you get a yacht?

I rented it.

I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.

And there is that thing we need to talk about...

Okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.

I can work with an hour.

I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this out till 2:00 a.m. you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

Right.

Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.

I'll see you soon.

Thinking Rudy att*cked Batista doesn't make any sense.

He's a loving boyfriend.

He spends his life helping people in need.

He brought me steaks.

Well, that's just rude.

Why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock?

And a security camera?

How do I get his DNA now?

At times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, and less -- ripe.

But Harry taught me to trust my gut. "People lie all the time," he said. "But your instinct will never fail you."

Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

[f*ck me!]

I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.

Did you do all this?

In fact -- I did.

You like?

I like.

I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.

Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.

I'm sorry.

I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutes to get here.

I have to turn around and go right back.

Oh, my God. Hold on.

Hold on. Wait!

Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...

Here it goes.

I know this seems fast...

But I feel --

I feel that I waited my whole entire life for you.

And now that you're here, I don't want you to leave.

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

I knew it! I f*cking knew it!

Is that your version of a "yes"?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, but --

No, no, no! Stop at "yes." "Yes", I like that part.

Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

Like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.

I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but --

Okay, I get it.

You do?

No, not really, but I can work with it.

Good, good.

Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?

Yes, but...

There's a condition.

I know you have to go to work, but...

If you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.

One glass of champagne. That's all I ask.

Rudy, I --

I mean it.

You can't leave your sort-of fiancé

on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopened bottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.

Just one glass of champagne... to celebrate.

And then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck k*ller.

I can live with that.

Hey, I need these two tested against each other.

It's kind of a rush.

Excuse me, hi.

Hey, these two -- Tested against each other right now.

Okay.

It's Deb. Do it.

Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air. I need to talk to you.

I'm in the building.

This yacht's amazing.

I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

Well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.

Was that just the phone ringing?

Yeah -- Big brother.

I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.

Good. I want you all to myself.

So... let the toasting begin. To... what comes next.

You're not drinking?

Tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

Just bad memories.

That's right. That was the -- the one clue the ice-truck k*ller left behind, right?

Right.

Wait. How did you know that?

I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.

Hilarious.

Your champagne's gonna get warm.

You know the one thing I've been dying to ask you?

How did you not know who I was?

You're a cop.

This isn't funny.

I think a real cop would... at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting. Right?

You're hurting me.

I didn't show you the best part of my loft.

Built it myself.

Stop it!

The refrigerated room.

Oh, God, why are you doing this?!

You know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.

The other women I could just pay.

But at the end...

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Stop.

Dude, you got to see this.

The autopsy on our Santa's cottage victim? Check it out.

One arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.

I mean, our guy isn't sloppy.

He's precise.

Not now, Vince.

Her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right.

I mean, why? Why cut off more on the left side than the right?

Because our girl...

Our girl was a f*cking amputee.

I looked up her medical records.

She had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.

The k*ller cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.

Let me see that.

That night Batista was stabbed, he was following up on a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.

Guess what the lead was about.

The ice-truck k*ller.

Booyah.

You sure?

Positive.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

Hey, you all right?

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.

Sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.

It's Deb. Do it.

Where the f*ck are you?

I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

Call me when you get this.

Previously on "Dexter"...

I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?

Female victim, cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck k*ller? So soon?

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Dexter...

Laura Moser...

My mother.

Laura Moser and 3 others found chopped up with a chain saw.

Your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.

Angel was stabbed from behind.

You think it's the attacker's blood?

We know Batista fought back.

The samples you gave me were a match.

They're from the same person.

So if you or that skinny b*tch try to screw with what's mine, I swear to God, I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.

You've been a problem.

I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.

I have no f*cking idea why I'm in this place.

You really don't want to do this.

Effective immediately, you will no longer serve as my lieutenant.

This isn't f*cking over, Tom!

Debra Morgan...

Will you marry me?

Yes, yes, yes.

Where's my sister?

Took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.

She went to dinner? She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Where the f*ck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not.

I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

I've lived in darkness a long time.

Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I don't have much time -- or, to be more accurate, my sister doesn't have much time.

He wants me to find him, but where do I look?

I can't think.

It's too bright.

Let me know if the tape's too tight.

You know, there's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

Why are you doing this?

Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.

Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Shh, I'm just checking the supplies, okay?

Things are moving a little faster than I had planned.

This isn't you.

Pretty sure it is.

No!

I know there's more -- I've seen it.

I never wanted to hurt you.

I know. I know.

Does this make it easier for you? Because I can keep going.

Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jesus Christ!

There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb. I mean, you're not the only one who bought it, okay?

Your name isn't even f*cking Rudy Cooper, is it?

Nope...

But he died for a good cause.

Yeah, so will you.

You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

Not some invisible hooker -- you kidnapped a cop!

It's all part of the plan.

Oh, Jesus.

It's hard to believe it's almost come to fruition.

I mean, this is a lot of years in the making.

We're only hours away.

He wouldn't have taken Deb unless he left me everything a clever monster would need in order to find them.

♪ Born free, ♪

♪ As free as the wind blows ♪

♪ As free as the grass grows ♪

♪ Born free to follow your heart ♪

Seems I have a new screen saver.

I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded, but "Born free"?

Of course.

Thanks to Rudy, now I know where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

Born free of all that's human --

That's where I'll find him.

She knows.

She knows.

All f*cking night with that.

She knows.

Listen, Angel, we need your help.

Masuka says you were following up a lead on the ice-truck k*ller when you were att*cked.

A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

John painted her nails different colors, but it didn't go nowhere.

Except she was just cut up by the ice-truck k*ller.

Holy sh*t. Monique was a victim?

Now, we're operating on the theory that he found out you were on his trail.

And if we're right, that means you got stabbed for a reason. It wasn't no carjacking.

How did he know it was me?

No one knew what I was doing except Masuka.

Someone else had to know. Think.

I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend, the prosthetics guy.

But that's crazy, right?

No, she's been AWOL since going out last night to meet him.

She was supposed to come back and help me canvass, but she never made it.

That's not like her.

Angel, we got to go.

Go, just go.

There are roughly 5,000 cargo containers in the port of Miami.

Finding the one where my mother was butchered took a bit of magic.

Busted.

Busted.

sh*t.

Just a second!

I told you he was here.

There some reason you're not answering your damn phone?

Ambien.

What happened here, Dexter?

I couldn't find the remote.

Where's your sister?

She didn't come back to work, and she's not at her apartment.

I honestly don't know, sergeant.

Dexter...

We think her boyfriend Rudy's connected to the ice-truck k*ller.

We're working on getting a search warrant right now to search his home.

No. Wow...

Cut the crap.

You know something. What?

James!

I saw him last night, skulking in the lab, ordering secret blood tests.

What kind of tests?

I was looking for a type match on the blood on Batista's collar.

And whose was it?

Rudy's.

m*therf*cker.

Knock it off!

He knew all along!

Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.

Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

It was just a wild hunch.

Why didn't you tell us?

I couldn't destroy Deb's love life on a hunch.

I had to get the facts.

Here are the facts: if he kills her, it's your fault. Now, what else do you know?

That's it.

He's lying.

Give him a break, James. It's his sister, all right?

Well, if he knows what's good for her, he'll sit his a*s at home and answer the f*cking phone when it rings.

Call if you hear anything.

Hello?

Please don't hang up.

Paul?

The kids don't want to talk to you, all right?

You got to give them more time.

This isn't about them.

It's about how I was arrested.

Yeah, with a needle in your arm -- I know all about it.

Well, I don't.

Listen, I take responsibility for all the sh*t I pulled, but, Rita, I was in the program.

I kicked the hard stuff.

Well, apparently not.

I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.

It's been driving me nuts how I got -- from your house one minute to the motel room the next, completely out of my mind on junk.

Yeah, it's called a blackout, Paul.

It's called a setup.

Well done.

The last thing I remember was standing in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

Now, he could have smacked me over the head and dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard.

You really are a piece of work.

I'm telling you --

Dexter is not who you think he is.

Hello?

This one, I've got to make sure we got about seven copies of these.

I want to make sure it's distributed to everyone, okay?

Okay, his name is Rudy Cooper.

Some of you may have met him.

He was dating officer Morgan.

Now, she was last seen 16 hours ago, driving to meet him at the Miami Beach marina.

So we need to canvass the entire area.

Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

I've already sent a team over to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

The judge just signed off on the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

Well, let's tear that place apart.

Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

Your attention, please.

I want to introduce you to our new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal.

She agreed to put her vacation on hold, come in early, to provide us with some much-needed leadership at this critical time.

Lieutenant, you're on.

I understand we have a new suspect in the ice-truck k*ller case.

We're on our way over now to search his place.

And you are...

Maria Laguerta.

And we have an officer missing, so we need to move fast.

I thought that sergeant Doakes was running that investigation.

He's out following a lead.

What lead?

He said he'd let me know if it came to anything. Now if you excuse me --

I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

Who here can get me up to speed on the way over?

I can, I guess.

You're driving.

And feel free to join us when you locate your partner.

Would you like to come with us, captain?

You seem to have everything under control.

Let's go, people.

It's in there somewhere --

My birthplace.

Now what?

No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

With billions spent on Homeland Security, it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

So much for the w*r on terror.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

I don't like this place.

Something nameless was born here...

Something that lives in the deepest, darkest hole of the thing called "Dexter."

Get in there!

Somebody else -- Get in there now!

It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

Nothing will hurt you -- I promise.

Okay, Deb... don't be dead.

sh*t.

Surprise, m*therf*cker.

Are you following me now?

You better have a hell of a reason for being here.

I'm looking for my sister.

In a cargo box?

Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.

You forget you work for the f*cking cops?

We love theories. Spin me a story, as*h*le.

What I do on my time is my business, sergeant.

Yeah, me too, and I'm on my time now.

There's no lieutenant here to save your a*s, so don't f*ck with me, Morgan!

All right, you got me.

I ordered some furniture from Thailand.

I was waiting for it to be delivered.

Lab geek -- My a*s.

Hey, what the hell's going on over here?!

Security, I need to get somebody down here right now.

Miami metro P.D.

Yeah Is this guy under arrest?

That's a good question.

You're connected to this.

I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out, and some of what I find is gonna stick to your a*s.

Let me out of here, m*therf*cker!

Let me out of here!

Let me out! Let me out! Let me out, you piece of sh*t!

Let me out of here, you f*cking piece -- Aah!

f*ck! Let me out!

Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio, and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

Bye!

His happy place, where he kills more than time --

This is where he'd leave me a clue.

Hey, Dexter, better bundle up.

I like the cold.

You know, hypothermia can easily sneak up on you.

Yeah, and so can hypochondria.

And a home setup like this would take years to put together.

He must have hated leaving it behind.

What are you looking for?

A clue, signature or calling card --

Anything that might give us a sense of where he went.

Well, I don't think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this.

I mean, look at this place.

Hey, you were right about the victim at Santa's cottage.

He rushed his work.

He k*lled that girl to keep us busy so he could escape, but he wouldn't go without leaving us a message.

We just need to find it.

Check this out.

This is where he played with his meat.

Pretty whacked out, huh?

I can think of 101

uses for this table.

Know what I mean?

He has my sister, Vince.

Right.

I mean -- I didn't mean -- I'm sorry.

sh*t.

You're Karen, right?

That's right.

You're in charge of evidence -- this entire room -- evidence.

Take photos of every item in its original position: work-kit, packages...

Show me the inventory list when you're done.

Is he in charge?

Guess he is now.

Rita?

Rita?

Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

Can I help you?

I guess Paul never mentioned me.

I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

Right.

So, having your sponsor do your dirty work --

Which step is that?

See, he's -- he's just concerned for the kids.

No, he's concerned for himself. If you'll excuse me...

I thought he was lying, too, until I saw the proof.

What proof?

Well, the X-rays the prison doctor took of Paul's head --

They showed a skull fracture.

Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

No. You didn't.

See, after you struck him, the hospital took X-rays -- No fracture.

But in prison, a fracture.

If you know Paul, you'd know he'd bash his own head against the wall to get what he wants.

Well, I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.

No, listen, if Paul was att*cked, the way that it happened -- that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Yeah, which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

Bob...

You seem like a nice man, but this is none of your g*dd*mn business.

Okay. Got it.

We traced the name and social of Rudy Cooper to a New Jersey plumber who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding me. After all this, we still don't have an I.D. on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

You trying to be smart?

Not trying, no.

If you f*cking know his name, you better --

Whatever it is going on between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious, a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he k*lled them all, but I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment before I go.

Yeah, okay.

You mind if I...

Be my guest.

It's perfect -- Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this record player?

Yeah, a f*cking doll sitting on top. "Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood, to a place where a boy was born? "Home sweet home", but which "home"?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser -- addict, dealer --

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha -- Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

You know, I've never even been here before. I'd love a tour sometime.

Yeah, sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, okay? She's in trouble.

Oh, God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious, but I just can't worry about you, too, right now.

She knows. She knows. She knows.

...been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping about it ain't gonna change it. Shut the f*ck up!

The suspect is operating under an alias -- "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints in our criminal database, so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows. She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych overflow from County, but this one's harmless.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho K*llers over there.

I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to I.D. them somehow.

That should take care of him. Enjoy the peace and quiet.

I.D. tech.

Hey, it's, uh, Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints against psych, mental, and institution records.

♪ Ring around the rosie ♪

♪ A pocket full of posies ♪

Dexter! Dexter!

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm gonna find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose. I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

Here!

Oh, my goodness!

Oh my goodness!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there!

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying "Brian."

I have a brother.

A real brother --

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die --

It's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chain saw, the flying body parts, the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood before they found us, but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

Debra!

She's not in here.

Deb!

Debra!

This is not the way I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down and have a beer.

Deb?

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard, bend your knees, okay?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

Okay, let's run his description against Interpol's fugitive list, in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper?

His real name is Brian Moser.

Angel, what the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints from a Tampa mental hospital where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured. They released him.

Run the name "Brian Moser" for credit cards, bank accounts, real-estate holdings -- anything that might tell us where he's got Morgan.

Listen up.

We've triangulated officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location --

20 miles off the coast, which means he's got her on a boat.

Lieutenant, we have his real name. We're digging into his records now.

His name's not gonna help us find him in open water.

I want a coordinated search with the coast guard.

Waste of time.

Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

Lieutenant, that signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press, but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews, and he calls the sh*ts.

Look, I know you need to define yourself here and putting me in my place is one way to do that, but one of our own is missing, and we shouldn't waste our time pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned, and it has nothing to do with incompetence and everything to do with the Captain trying to save his job.

Okay.

Now, I was hired with the directive to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well, but luckily for officer Morgan, neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I swore that I'd have a -- beer with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother, the same lie they tried forcing me into. "They"?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders --

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were 3, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene -- Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me --

I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a f*cked-up kid --

They all did, so they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised by the Morgan family, I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going through all these years --

The isolation, the otherness, a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me -- your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims --

Are they all K*llers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

To survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I k*ll.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A k*ller...

...without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

Damn it, Dex, you don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead 10 years.

You can't keep him sitting on your shoulder like Jiminy f*cking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from your family since you were 3, but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Oh, no. Don't -- Don't say that.

I'm very... fond of her.

You can't be a k*ller and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Morgan!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

f*ck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

Cover this door! Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me. sh*t.

Maria, stay on the door. He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

sh*t.

Chopper 1 to command --

We're broadening the search to a 5-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to transport you to the hospital --

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

I think he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He said he was having second thoughts about k*lling Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd k*ll Deb if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost f*cking got her k*lled.

I'm gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Morgan.

Back the f*ck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a f*cking hero!

Want each of you to treat him that way, god damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Oh, God, get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax. Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

Yeah.

I'm gonna talk to Captain Matthews about getting us an officer stationed outside your hospital room tonight.

No, I'm not staying in a f*cking hospital.

There's nothing f*cking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared.

I was so scared, so scared.

I know.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

Dexter?

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter --

He hasn't been himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

All right, that's it. I'm done.

Call again, and you can forget about seeing the kids this weekend or ever.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes for you to listen to me.

I just want to know that they're safe.

Why are you doing this, Paul?

You want me to be miserable and alone like you? Is that it?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen. Could be in the backyard.

It's missing. I checked, and it wasn't in the items that they got from the motel room when I was arrested.

And why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged when Dexter dragged me out, when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother who accepts me, sees me, for an adopted sister who'd reject me if she knew and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was -- A betrayal.

The most important single fact about me --

I'm not alone -- and Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

Mr. Morgan?

That's me.

Your sister has a few bruises, but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's okay, right?

She can go home with you tonight, far as I'm concerned, or we can keep her here at the hospital -- it's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at "Chez Dex".

I'll be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side just to make sure you're safe tonight, but...

We're gonna have to talk tomorrow about a long-term plan, after you get a good night's sleep.

Deb?

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I -- One of your victims now?

You going to collect a little sample of Bynie's blood for your slide collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

...but you need to be put down.

Why?

Because of your code?

The safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you, and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by k*lling her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve my knife than anyone.

You're the only one I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you --

Sorry.

I can't hear any more... 'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on the knife, a note on the fridge, and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear su1c1de.

He does himself the same way he did the hookers.

Poetic.

Ret*rded.

Look at him

-- He's dead.

The ice-truck k*ller always flaunted his kills like he was untouchable.

By taking his own life, he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.

I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, nonfat, no whip -- your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess --

Falling for a serial k*ller.

What are the odds?

What about you?

What about me?

Are you all right?

Oh, yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time with you -- and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so --

Next time, could you just let me know what's going on?

I mean, when you didn't return my calls, I -- started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon, and the fiddler's tune is far from over.

Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like for everything inside me that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra --

She's here to face what's left of the monster, spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter will be damned if she lets anyone see what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I k*lled the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone else would probably thank me if they knew I was the one who drained him of his life.

Good job in there, Dex. You sliced him up good.

In fact, deep down, I'm sure they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, buddy.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight, my darkness revealed, my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them... in their darkest dreams.Previously on "Dexter"..

Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen again and again.

Has to happen.

There he is. He's the one.

You're mine now, so do exactly as I say.

You better be a cop.

No... Forensics.

There is no blood near the body at all.

It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

I've never seen such clean, dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

How is he doing? How does the k*ller get rid of the blood?

One of these days, you're gonna tell me.

I told you blood spatter doesn't take up all my time.

How the hell was your date with Rita last night?

Great.

She's perfect because Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Open your eyes and look at what you did!

Please, you have to understand.

Trust me. I definitely understand.

Hello?

What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing up a little project, but I'll come by later.

They found another hooker.

Another one?

That's the third one in five months.

Third? You mean there's a...

Serial k*ller, that's right.

Dex, there are people out there who do really bad things.

Of course, you have to learn how to spot them, but I can teach you.

The k*ller flayed the skin, the flesh, completely off.

Why would he do that?

He's experimenting, Trying to find the right way.

He's certainly raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

The k*ller is an artist.

You give me the f*cking creeps. You know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

But now we have a fourth body, The ritual is changing.

I'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks have been stolen in the last week or so.

It just seems odd.

Your sister has this ice-truck theory, and then here you are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant. You should give her a chance.

I think this is a friendly message. "Hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.

I dream.

I dream I'm floating on the surface of my own life, watching it unfold, observing it.

I'm the outsider, looking in.

Yeah! Man!

You want to play, man?! Come on!

In the water!

Look at them. They can laugh and play.

It comes so easily for them.

Even though I'm not one of them, even though sometimes I can really be a monster... today, I'm just...

...a sea monster.

Soon enough, I'll have to go back to doing what I do...

So I make a point of enjoying days like this when I have them.

Just a second.

The ice-truck k*ller left me a gruesome souvenir.

Explaining it could be kind of...

...awkward.

Hey.

Bagels, brother. Let me in.

Could it be more depressing in here?

Got anything to drink? It's hot as hell out there.

O.J.?

With ice.

So, how you doing?

I'm fine.

Yeah, things are fine.

Breakfast, which I already had, was fine, but... you know me... I'm always hungry.

So, what's up, hotshot?

All right, get this...

Lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck in every swamp, glade, and chop shop from here to the Keys.

But the way I see it, that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car.

It's not as if he's shy.

You think he's hiding the truck in plain sight, wanting it to be found?

I could answer that if Laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers, looking for a witness...

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

Tell me about it.

Just because Laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time doesn't mean you can't look for the truck...

...On my time!

What's with these?

I've got court.

Why is it we never talk brother-sister stuff?

Our dad was a cop. You're a cop. I work for the cops.

For us, this is brother-sister stuff.

Brings out your eyes.

First he throws a severed head at me, then he leaves me these doll parts, like pieces of a puzzle.

I like puzzles.

But there's nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then it still doesn't make sense.

Please state your name and occupation.

My name is Dexter Morgan, and I'm a forensics specialist in blood-spatter analysis for the Miami metro police department.

And how long have you been doing blood-spatter analysis?

Almost twelve years.

You've been involved in quite a few cases, then.

2,103.

Give or take.

No, 2,103.

Then it's safe to say blood is your life.

Safe to say.

Unlike the other guys down at the station, I love coming to court to rub shoulders with the good people of the Sunshine State...

...and Sasquatch.

In a courthouse, everyone's on their best behavior...

...like they're being watched.

And they are.

Some people would look at this family and see only tragedy and heartbreak.

But I see so much more than that.

I'll do this, okay?

I see opportunity.

Alexander Pryce finished his homework, kissed his mom, went out for a jog.

He told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans.

Just another night, until...

...until the defendant not only struck him with his car but fled the scene, leaving Alexander Pryce alone and dying for hours before his body was found the next morning...

From heinous to unspeakable.

The people will prove that not only did Mr. Chambers strike and k*ll Alexander Pryce but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol.

Happy birthday, Alex!

Thank you.

Rip right into it.

What?

Yeah.

Hope it's money.

Yeah, you wish.

Surprise.

Thanks, guys. It's like 80 degrees out.

But next year at this time, we're coming to visit you at Harvard.

It's everything I've ever wanted for you, Alexander.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

I see their pain.

On some level, I even understand their pain.

I just can't feel their pain.

It just a Matter of time before we see how far Matt Chambers's crocodile tears will get him.

But until then, a little of my favorite tropical fruit...

The perfect driving food next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

Also, I can keep my energy up for the day job.

Detective!

Buena.

Buena?

Did we get an I.D.?

First on scene pulled the wallet.

We're still waiting.

Hello, Dex.

Her boss - Lieutenant Laguerta.

In keeping with her total sense of entitlement, she has this attraction to me.

And I thought I was creepy.

Given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter, distance had to be a 50-, 60-foot drop.

The eastbound's only 40 feet.

It's not high enough for this kind of damage so...

...best guess, originating point is the westbound causeway.

Get me a team on the westbound causeway!

She's good.

Angel, look at this.

I think there's something in his mouth.

Medic!

It's just a death rattle. He's gonzo.

You better check out my friend, too.

No telling what this guy might have had.

This is what he had.

Call me crazy, Angel, but I think this is human flesh.

Hooked up with Sean last night.

The cable-guy Sean?

God, no.

He smelled like cheese.

So the mechanic Sean?

Yep.

He came over.

We opened a bottle of Pinot gris.

We finished a bottle of Pinot gris.

Before I knew it, we were...

Stop that.

You don't want to hear this, do you?

No.

But if you two are getting serious, I'd love to meet him.

Why don't you and Sean the mechanic join me and Rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night?

Why?

So you can tell me later he's not good enough for your little sister?

Don't.

You're the one who was going on about brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

And that becomes brother-and-sister double-dating?

Because I'm on head of yours.

Come on. It'll be fun.

All right, we'll go, but I'm not promising we'll have any fun.

Not now.

What crawled up his a*s?

He hates lab rats.

Well, here's a headline...

It's lab rats that make us cops look good.

Okay, listen up.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons.

He was a cop.

Let me ask you something.

Yeah.

When we were partners, you used to use every excuse in the book to get out of making a next-of-kin notification.

I knew Ricky from the department softball team.

He was a good guy, a good cop. It's the least I could do.

m*therf*cker!

Call it in!

3H-77 to dispatch.

We need E.M.T. and police backup now.

I'll check the house.

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You're okay.

It's me.

It's okay.

This is so f*cked-up, man.

Going after a cop's family...

Who would do such a thing?

That's why we're here.

But it's still f*cked-up.

They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

All right. Thanks.

He'd been working the gig for 10

months, and everything was good.

But this...

Going after his wife...

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

Is there any word on the wife?

She should be in surgery by now.

¿Qué pasó?

There's an inconsistency somewhere.

And that would be?

I'm not sure, but it's the answer to a question we haven't thought of yet.

Look.

Whose is it?

Probably hers.

Ricky Simmons, her husband - Last number dialed.

I got it.

Good work, Angel.

Well, actually, it was Dexter.

Sergeant?

98, 99, 100!

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new world record!

Stop it!

Can't stop! Must tickle!

Got to hear the magic word!

I have your magic word right here.

Chocolate chip.

Cookies!

Homemade.

Okay, you guys, take your cookies into the bedroom.

Two each.

But you never let us eat in our bedroom.

Well, I want some alone time with Dexter.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

Cool.

Gross!

Cookie?

I wuv cookies.

Well, you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster.

No, this isn't snarfing. This is eating with enthusiasm.

Tell me about your day.

I had court... You know, the blood thing.

And then a crime scene and more blood.

I don't know how you do it.

Well, blood is...

...my life.

...my job.

Lately, the thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

But whenever that happens with a woman, when I feel comfortable with her, it all goes wrong.

That's why I think it's best to take it one step at a time.

Hey, you know, Deb has been all over me for us to get together with her new boyfriend.

You think you can get a babysitter some night?

You mean an actual grown-up meal?

I'd love that. Make a date.

I pick you.

And I pick my sister to chaperon.

Sister.

So, Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle, right?

Okay.

And, brother, I just found the f*cking needle!

How'd you find it?

I put the word out with patrol...

You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing.

Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me.

This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?

The restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

I feel like a kid at his own surprise party.

This is the same truck.

It's hard to say. It all happened so fast.

Let's go on a nonforensic-geek limb here and say that it is.

Why is it still running?

It keeps the back compartment refrigerated.

Dios mío.

Holy sh*t, they're f*cking fingertips.

Clean slices, no blood.

My guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made.

How'd he do that? Some kind of pump?

No.

I had forensics do a workup on our last victim.

Our guy's old school.

Yeah, he hoists the body up, severs the jugular.

The heart does all the work.

It's the most effective method, really.

f*cking butcher.

There are 206 bones in the human body.

He could have left any one of them.

But he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim, like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs.

Who made the find?

Officer Morgan.

Harry's daughter?

Must be in the genes, her and her brother.

This truck's a good get.

It's their first solid lead.

I encourage all my officers to think outside the box.

Well, nice work, lieutenant.

I got the Deputy-Mayor.

Congratulate Morgan for me.

Another beautiful Miami day -

Mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon shows.

Chalk one up for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

Last time I checked, Morgan, I'm the lieutenant, which means my officers keep me apprised at all times on all things.

You pull a stunt like that again, it won't matter who your father was.

Okay?

Dude, is this blood?

It's chocolate. It's on your shirt, too.

It's a new shirt.

What is taking so long?

It's a big truck.

They won't find anything, not even a Tic Tac.

He's thought all this through.

I know I would.

Your famous hunches telling you anything?

Ice cold.

You're a g*dd*mn riot.

This f*cking guy's toying with us.

Deb's right.

This truck's not another piece of the puzzle...

...They are.

Watching ice melt... This is fun.

Stand a little closer, Morgan, and I'll melt your heart.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex.

Yo, I was talking to Morgan the sister.

Vince Masuka only swings one way.

Yeah, from vine to vine.

Enough.

I'm glad to see the sexual-harassment seminar really paid off.

This is seriously f*cked-up, my friends.

Why go to all this trouble?

What's this sick son of a b*tch trying to tell us?

Not "us". Me.

My freezer, the painted doll's fingernails...

I think he's trying to impress me...

And it's working.

What, a man can't call his wife three times in one day?

Sí, claro.

Bueno.

Kiss my baby and tell her, "daddy be home para la cena".

I'm getting another call.

Yeah, te amo.

Batista.

¿De veras? I'll be there in two minutes.

She's still in surgery.

The doctors are hopeful.

Ice-truck k*ller returns, dead undercover cop -

It's a typical day in the neighborhood.

You got to hear this.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

I'm gonna try for the back door.

f*ck, he saw me!

Please don't hurt me!

Lieutenant!

National database kicked back the DNA match.

Norberto Cervantes.

Let me see that.

Dame. Ahora.

Es tu día de mala suerte.

Estoy agradecido por tu lealdad.

El gusto es mío, patrón.

Police! Put your hands up!

Police! Put your hands up!

Get them down!

Put your f*cking hands up! Put your hands up!

Is that necessary?

It's a dangerous world, Guerrero.

Yes, and one can't be too careful, detective.

Yes, I-I've had alc...

...problems with alcohol in the past.

I never tried to hide that.

But... you heard from my A.A. sponsor.

I- I've been sober for over a year now.

Look, I-I'm not disputing that... that it was my car... that hit Mr. Pryce.

But...

I reported it stolen hours before the accident.

Men like Matt Chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy, even empathy, and otherwise right-thinking people don't stand a chance. "Not guilty".

Matt Chambers may have found a way to beat the system...

...but so have I.

Ricky, where the f*ck are you?

f*ck, he saw me.

Please don't hurt me!

The way we see it, you're in on the k*ll of Ricky Simmons, but that's not enough for you or for Guerrero.

Ricky is dead?

That saddens me.

Shut the f*ck up!

Wait, you're not implying that Ricky Simmons was a cop, are you?

I'm truly disappointed.

Not only do I have a dead cop, someone broke in his house and shot his wife.

Word out in the world, sergeant...

Simmons's wife was f*cking around.

Maybe he tried to k*ll the b*tch himself, and felt so bad about it, he committed su1c1de.

A cop m*rder-su1c1de...

It's a health crisis for you guys, ain't it?

You think it's a f*cking coincidence your a*s is in here?!

We got you on the causeway the morning Ricky Simmons died!

Bullshit.

We don't deal in bullshit.

We deal in good police work...

And good science.

You must have been a m*therf*cker at cat's cradle.

I never played it.

Okay, Kara Simmons was shot while she was running.

Her phone call tells us that, right?

And she was running towards the back door... There.

She turns.

The sh**t sees her.

She's shot high on the chest.

It spins her around, spraying blood on the walls there... and there.

She loses her cellphone.

She struggles with the coffee table, the couch, and then she finally falls back, "Pop"... There.

She never got this far.

It's not her blood.

Angel, meet our sh**t.

DNA of Cervantes' flesh in Ricky Simmons' mouth.

DNA from a rogue drop of blood we found at the Simmons' house.

Tell me you're sure about this.

100%.

That puts Cervantes at both crime scenes.

Let's nail his coffin and ship it.

Hang on, sergeant.

We get him to roll over on Guerrero and we own them both.

You're talking about throwing him a deal?

And then, what? He walks?

If he does, we pick him up on other charges.

If he gets us Guerrero, it's win-win.

Gets us Guerrero?! We can't catch the guy.

He's un-f*cking-touchable!

Come on, lieutenant.

We already got a win.

It's not about your win.

It's about the big picture.

I've seen this before.

Whenever a cop is k*lled, it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid-sentence.

Davey Sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop.

Davey Sanchez was a son, a husband, and a father.

Davey Sanchez was my partner.

Davey Sanchez was my hero.

That was great.

What, dad?

Ever since Davey was k*lled, my world feels out of control.

How do you fix it?

Two ways, I guess...

Honor Davey's memory...

...and catch the bastard who did this to him.

It's not about vengeance.

It's not about retaliation...

...or balancing the books.

It's about something deep inside.

My father had more than his share of pain.

But he didn't deal with it the way most people do.

Happy hour... Now, there's a misnomer.

I'll have what he's having.

Wise choice.

You celebrating?

Something like that.

Hey, have we met?

I doubt it. I just moved down here.

I needed a new start.

Girlfriend or boyfriend?

Ex-wife.

She said I drank too much.

Hence the "ex" part.

f*ck her.

Man, she was all over me to change, like she never done anything wrong in her life...

Besides marrying me.

We all make mistakes.

Unfortunately, mine usually involve lawyers.

God! Damn it!

I thought I was the only one who hated the Hurricanes.

I take it you didn't grow up in Miami.

No, I've had to move around some.

Say no more.

But home is where my a*s is.

I'm getting mine out of town.

Enjoy Miami.

Remember, there's nothing a new city can't cure.

You got that right.

Thanks, buddy.

Next one's on me.

You sure you're good to drive?

Been a lot worse.

I sure hope he doesn't go out there and k*ll himself.

That would be... tragic.

Matt Chambers is accused of committing a crime in Florida.

He was arrested in Florida, and he's being tried in Florida.

So the good people of Florida only went as far as validating their own assumptions that Matt Chambers is a Florida bad guy. "Nothing a new city can't cure".

My father taught me one thing above all others...

To be sure.

And I am.

Matt Chambers, Miami is your last stop.

If God is in the details, and if I believed in God, then he's in this room with me.

I just wish he'd brought an extension cord.

It's James.

We're gonna get the bastard who did this to you.

This guy is just toying with us, and Laguerta's too f*cking dumb to see it.

Yeah, Deb was saying that this psycho guy cut off that chick's fingertips?

Man, that's got to suck, right?

Guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive -

That's not his style.

He usually leaves the k*lling to someone else.

So, how long have you two been going out?

A couple weeks, I guess.

Deb never mentioned how you met.

Well, she brought her car into my shop, and...

You have your own place?

No, but I wish I did.

Some day, huh?

Dex, enough with the Inquisition.

No, it's all right.

If I had a sister with legs like yours, I'd be checking out the dude she was seeing, too.

Is this guy a keeper or what?

Come on. I'll get you another drink.

Are you guys good?

Yep.

Seems like a nice guy.

They could barely keep their hands off each other.

I can k*ll a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for "Letterman".

But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

I'm totally lost.

Off your a*s, Cervantes.

Hands behind your back. Walk backwards and assume the position.

Step away.

Exit the cell.

Where are we going?

The call came down.

They want you moved to a more secure block.

You think the call to take care of me came down from the warden?

Who the f*ck do you think the warden listens to?

Get used to it.

That's from Mr. Guerrero.

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Are you sleeping?♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Brother John♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Morning bells are ringing♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

♪ Ding ding dong♪

Every time a woman tries to do this to me, it...

...tickles.

Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

What?

The kids.

They sleep through thunderstorms.

I'm sorry.

Tell me... wh...?

I- I can't do this.

It's okay.

That's okay.

I'm okay.

We have an elephant in the room, and its name is "Sex".

Tell me about it.

As far as I'm concerned, it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business.

It's easier said than done.

Yeah.

But it needs to be right...

For both of us.

Or it won't be right for either of us.

I don't want that. Do you?

No.

You know...

I can't believe I found the one good, truly decent man left on the planet.

...was found dead in a basement hallway of the Miami metro jail.

Norberto Cervantes was a known associate of reputed drug lord Carlos Guerrero.

Speculation is that another inmate is responsible for the mayhem here tonight.

Notice how the skin is gloving around the joints?

And that is important because?

A sure sign of postmortem severance, meaning the victim was already dead when she was...

...relieved of her fingertips.

Why the different nail polishes?

What the hell is this guy thinking?

He's thinking, "Tag, Dexter, you're it".

I don't know. Do you have an I.D.?

Shari Taylor. Another hooker.

At least he's consistent.

Yeah.

k*lling young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive...

...or feed their kids.

My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is.

Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.

I don't care who these fingertips belong to, only what my new friend out there is trying to say.

Morgan? The Captain wants you.

Her.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Lieutenant Laguerta has something she wants to tell you.

Officer Morgan, you've shown tremendous initiative these last few days.

Because of you, we were able to track down that ice truck, and we now have an I.D. on the latest victim.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

And I concur. Congratulations.

You're a good cop, like your old man.

Thank you, sir!

Thank you so much.

You keep this up and I see a detective shield in your future.

I won't let you down, sir.

I hope you know what you're doing.

I promoted you, didn't I?

Now find me this ice-truck son of a b*tch!

Okay?

Okay.

Y nina y tu hija, ¿cómo están?

Están maravillosas.

Tú sabes que ellas también te necesitan, ¿eh?

Angel, vete a tu casa.

Okay.

Burning the oil?

I clocked out.

Why are you going at this so hard?

When someone comes after one of us, he comes after all of us.

I know that look, Maria.

You got something to say, just say it.

I just got off the phone with the hospital.

Kara Simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago.

I got to be there.

James, she died.

Was Cervantes right?

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?!

What the f*ck business is it of yours?!

My cops, my precinct, my business!

Kara was gonna ask Ricky for a divorce as soon as he came off undercover. She didn't want to...

She didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case.

If I go by the book, I take you off the case.

f*ck the book.

There's nobody in this building more motivated to get...

Revenge?

Justice.

Take point on Guerrero.

Thanks.

In slaughterhouses, they stun the animals before butchering them.

It's the humane thing to do.

Those animals, they're the lucky ones.

"Brother, meet me at Loco's Crab Shack. "Totally important. Do not let me down. Deb".

Gone to rest his weary head.

The good news is, he'll still be here when I come back for our own personal happy hour.

God, these are so good.

Not as good as your good news.

My little sister's all growed-up and transferred to Homicide.

And the best part...

Laguerta had to say the actual words.

I thought her head would explode.

I'm really proud of you.

You had my back the whole way, and I appreciate it.

I mean that.

You're the best.

And that's why I wanted to share this moment with you.

So, Sean was busy?

It turns out there's another woman.

Who?

Me.

Sean the mechanic is married?

Imagine me picking the wrong guy, huh?

And you and he are...

So over.

I dumped his married a*s.

I just wish I could get into a healthy relationship, like you and Rita, without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty.

Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

Jesus, dad, it's called being on time! Did you ever hear of it?

I was having a bad day.

The Captain and I had a discussion.

Well, maybe you sh...

Wait. W- What kind of bad day?

It's about the guy who k*lled Davey, isn't it?

The judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

That's not fair.

Life's not fair, Dexter.

Can't anyone do anything?

Can't you do something?

No, not now.

So what, then?

The world just keeps spinning out of control?

No.

The world can always be set right again.

That guy kills a cop, and nothing happens?

Not anymore.

Be back in a sec.

I'm kind of running the gamut here emotion-wise.

Nature calls.

All the planning, the making sure...

Does it go away because I have a chance to rid the world of a cop k*ller and balance the books?

Do I just ignore everything my father taught me about how to do this right, about how to stay safe so I can do it again?

Yep.

I don't give a sh*t about your g*dd*mn problems.

I gave you a job. You take care of it.

What the f*ck you looking at?

Happy birthday, Alex! Rip right into it.

But next year at this time...

It's you.

And you.

Thanks, dad.

All right, enough corniness.

We meet again...

...for the last time.

I didn't do anyth- Anything.

Some people believe that.

The problem is, I don't.

But it's true.

I was-- I was set up.

By whom?

That-- That family.

They needed someone to blame. It's a natural thing to do when you're grieving.

So then none of this is your fault?

I swear.

Okay! Okay! Okay! No!

Okay. Okay. Stop.

All right.

Okay, okay.

It-- It was me, only it wasn't me.

It was the booze.

It takes me over.

That's a point of view to which I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

Neither you nor I is in complete control of our destinies.

Although, at the moment, it would seem I have the upper hand.

Really, I'm so sorry.

You've done this too many times to be sorry.

Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.

That's his truth.

My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.

Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.

You'll like it here.

You and your neighbors have so much in common.

The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.

He came back and left nothing behind but a message -

Come find me.

And I will.

There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.Previously on "Dexter"...

What happened changed something inside you, Dex.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to k*ll is only gonna get stronger.

I want to catch this guy before he kills another one of my girls.

What can I do to help?

No blood. What a beautiful idea.

Refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, even feel violated, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "hey, want to play?"

Finding that truck is your golden ticket into Homicide.

So Miami's the haystack, and the ice truck's the needle.

I just found the f*cking needle.

Oh, this is seriously f*cked up, my friends.

I think he's trying to impress me...

...and it's working.

The Captain believes you should be reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

Thank you, sir.

Rita is, in her own way, as damaged as me.

Are you gonna kiss him?

Actually, yes.

We just got an I.D. on the body from under the causeway.

His name is Ricky Simmons. He was a cop.

They told me Ricky Simmons was under deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

Now he's gone and pissed off the entire Miami police department.

It's me. It's James, okay? It's okay.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky? Was it you?

James, she died.

Miami's full of good cops, a lot of them here today.

But no offense-- I wouldn't want any of you hitting on my sister.

Ricky was different.

He was the kind of guy you hoped your sister would fall for.

Most people have a hard time dealing with death, but I'm not most people.

It's the grief that makes me uncomfortable.

Not because I'm a k*ller--

Really. I just don't understand all that emotion, which makes it tough to fake.

I'm sorry, man.

Thanks, man.

It's a f*cking travesty.

You going after Guerrero?

Guerrero ordered these hits.

I'm gonna make something stick to that cartel c*cksucker.

I didn't know you and Ricky were so tight.

Ain't about that. f*ck with a cop, you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

I'm not right?

You're right.

...tragic loss of our fellow officer. But we praise his courage.

Ricky knew no fear.

People believe Laguerta? She didn't even know Simmons.

She knew he was a cop.

Wait. Did you tell her?

Proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

How you holding up?

I'm managing.

No, I'm not. Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow for two hours straight is a real chore.

A whole life reduced to ashes.

For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

But sometimes, you get a second chance.

Florida prisons kick free

25,000 inmates a year.

They don't do that for me, but it sure feels like it.

I search for the ones who think they've beat the system.

They're not hard to find, like Jeremy Downs.

Jeremy got off easy: four years in a juvenile facility for manslaughter.

To the coroner, the knife strokes looked random, impulsive, but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

Too many major arteries were severed--

Femoral, brachial, carotid.

Today Jeremy is just another piece of trash on the street, but four years ago, he was the toast of Miami.

It was a gruesome scene today--

The bloody body of a teenage boy found stabbed to death inside this south Miami park.

Police haven't released the name of the victim yet, but our sources are telling us that investigators are holding a 15-year-old suspect in custody.

We're hearing that the suspect lured the older boy to the pond to spot alligators, but once they were alone, the victim was robbed and repeatedly stabbed.

But I knew what he was and what he'd do again.

All I had to do was circle my calendar and wait.

Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

What do you say, crew? Anybody parched?

What's parched?

When we put in the new lemon tree, we'll be able to make our own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

Can we have a lemonade stand?

I'll apply for a business license first thing in the morning.

Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

You know, I moved here from Michigan with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

But they keep dying.

I can't help it. I k*ll things.

That must be awful. Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.

Bone meal works the best.

Hey, Rita.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

Don't get involved.

I never know in these situations.

I don't have money.

You got a car.

You want my car?

Yeah. The keys in it?

You know my dad?

I sure do, little man.

And you want to know something?

You look just like him.

I'm gonna tell him you said hi, okay?

Look, if you want, I could go in the house, throw your furniture around, make a real mess, but what kind of message would that send to the little ones?

Just give me the f*cking car.

Why don't you go inside and get the keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

What?

You think you can take me with your little red shovel?

Everything okay in there?

Yeah.

You need toilet paper?

No.

The guy clearly had no idea who he was dealing with.

I'll file a report at work. We'll get your car back.

No... No reports, Dexter. Thank you, but...

Paul's out of my life. I filed for divorce.

I just want my past to go away.

Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

Whatever it takes.

I can give you a ride to work until you get another car.

Or I could take the bus like millions of other people.

Come on, let's go outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

Come on, kids.

What did they use, an ax?

It's blunt force.

See the way the head's caved in?

You guys check out the new hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

She's a butter face.

What's a butter face?

You know, compadre--

She's got a hot body, but her face...

How great would it be to pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

Yeah? Mira a quí. You do it doggy-style, right?

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips and you yell another woman's name, and bam-- you're riding her like a bronco 'cause she's trying to buck you off.

Many times in life, I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them.

What are you doing? Oh, the bronco.

See, socia? She knows.

I just got my first official Homicide call.

He's back.

Who's back? The ice-truck k*ller?

That's right. You won't believe where he left the body.

I knew he'd be back. Feels like Christmas morning.

Look at that-- A miracle on ice. Stunning.

You all right, Dexter?

This is like a dream.

Standing on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

There's something about standing in a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

So, what do we know?

Same as the others. No blood.

So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts.

No bones flayed.

I think our boy's got his confidence back.

He never lost it. He was just getting bored.

What do you think he's trying to tell us?

That hockey's a violent sport.

What else?

He's escalating the thrill.

Posing his victim in the middle of a

20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show them-- to show us-- what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Relax. You didn't miss anything.

Yeah, but she is-- fingertips.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips we found in the truck.

Sherry Taylor. It's another prost*tute.

No blood-- no need for me.

Morgan, come up to the command center. We may have a suspect.

Is there really a suspect?

I'll let you know, bro, when I get back from my first official Homicide investiga--

I know her.

Sherry?

Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

We worked the same corner when I was undercover.

You were, like, friends?

Yes.

Do you want a hug?

f*ck off.

I tore apart the security office. A surveillance tape is missing.

Let me guess-- The one covering the ice.

They said you were good.

Don't bust my b*lls.

I've got the press knocking on the door outside.

Somebody who was here last night saw something--

Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew, crack whore in the men's room? Come on, work with me.

They got a night watchman, but we can't find him.

Well, then, he's a suspect.

Unless the ice-truck k*ller abducted him to gain entry into the arena.

Did your brother help you out with that logic?

The night watchman could've just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

We need to get to his apartment to see what we can find.

Actually, I was hoping I could hit Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.

Isn't that what you cried to the Captain last week?

Yeah, I mean...

I didn't cry.

Listen, my girls know this victim, okay?

They may have information that could help us.

No, I want you to work with Doakes.

Maria, she has contacts.

You still got your tube top?

And my nipple clamps.

Don't come back without any information.

Everyone moves to Miami to die, which means we have more junk than any city in America.

A skilled bargain hunter can find real treasure here, but that's not my idea of hunting.

I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

My instincts are impeccable, but I have to be sure of my prey.

We're all adrenaline rush, you know? k*ll it til it dies.

We all meat hunters, just out looking for dinner.

What you looking for?

Can I see that one?

Eh, good eye.

It's a fixed-blade skinning knife. Full tang, stainless steel.

Real time-saver for the hunter who likes to...

...do his own butchering in the field.

See the way that blade curves like that?

It's like the talon of an eagle.

15 bucks and she's yours.

I'll take it.

Hell, yeah, you'll take it. Why would you not?

I'll get your change.

Easy, kid.

What the f*ck are you doing, boy?

I didn't see him.

You all right, mister?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Honest mistake. No harm.

Hey. You be careful with that thing, huh?

Sorry about that, boss. I only sell them.

So, what you hunt-- trophies or meat?

What do you think today, Dex? The Winchester?

What about the 9mm?

A handgun?

Not exactly the w*apon of choice for pheasants.

You need a wide spread to bring them down.

Did you ever sh**t anybody, dad?

Afraid so.

Any of them die?

Just one.

How'd it feel... to k*ll a guy?

Not so great, Dex.

When you take a man's life, you're not just k*lling them.

You're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.

As a cop, I only fire my w*apon to save a life. That's a code I live by.

k*lling must serve a purpose. Otherwise, it's just plain m*rder.

You understand?

Yeah.

Changed my mind.

I think we'll take the Ruger.

r*fle? I thought that shotguns were best for pheasants.

We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

It's a big one.

Yeah.

This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

It's still alive.

For now, this hunt will control the urges you feel.

Channel them. Why don't you go ahead, son?

Really?

Put the poor animal out of its misery.

Hi, Rose.

Hi.

Congratulations on your confirmation.

Thank you. Do I know you?

My name's James Doakes. Miami metro P.D.

I'm investigating the m*rder of an undercover cop and his wife.

That's terrible. Were they members of the church?

No, Rose, they weren't.

I don't understand.

Rose, have you ever seen this man before?

I don't know. Why are you asking me?

Get away from my daughter.

It's okay.

At my church? In front of my family?

Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man, you did...

When you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

What is he talking about, daddy?

Come on, honey. Let's go.

Daddy.

Let's go!

You don't play by the rules, Guerrero. Why should I?

You've got five minutes, Bizach, okay?

Yo, look who's back.

Pero mirela, como está caliente!

Who'd you f*ck-- Dolce or Gabbana?

I let them both pull a train, okay?

Listen, I... I got a confession to make. I'm...

I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

Bridgett, get back-- Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust--

You're not a cop. You're a whore.

I'm not a f*cking whore.

f*cking who?

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore, huh?

We trusted you, Brandy.

My name's Debra, okay? And I'm not here to bust you.

He hit again-- The ice-truck k*ller. He got Cherry.

Cherry?

sh*t.

This sh*t's crazy. I'm out. I got a sister who lives in Ohio, runs a fashion-boutique store. I'm on the bus tomorrow.

I ain't closing my shop for no sick, psycho b*tch.

f*cking woman-hater.

I was on the street before him. f*ck it.

I can get him, you guys. You just got to give me something.

Did any of you all see Cherry with anyone the night before last?

Well, I saw her last night, and then she got into a car and never came back.

But I was working all night, so...

You know the driver?

No, but the car was, like, one of those old station wagons that have, like, wood panels on the side.

This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

I should go get Laguerta to listen.

Who's Laguerta?

She's my lieutenant. She hates me.

But I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

What?

Never piss off your pimp.

Laguerta's not my pimp.

Is that right?

b*tch tell you what to do?

Is your p*ssy taking all the grief?

Does she steal everything you earn?

Yeah, she definitely does that.

Then she's your pimp, baby, and she will mess you up if you play her.

I told you-- I'm not a f*cking whore.

What's wrong with being a f*cking whore?

Hey. Bought you a present to celebrate your first official homicide case.

Seriously? It's a cactus.

You only have to water it three times a year.

Gee, Dex, you didn't have to go out of your way.

I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

So, any news on our frosty friend?

One of my contacts said she saw Cherry getting in a wood-panel station wagon the night she died.

Did you check the DMV database?

As we speak. There are thousands of registered station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade county, but guess who's not on the list?

The night watchman.

I knew Laguerta had her head up her a*s on that one.

She doesn't have sh*t on the real ice-truck k*ller.

Good.

Why good?

It's good for you.

You're gonna be the one to apprehend that heinous m*rder*r, not her.

Thanks.

All right. Good night, sister.

Don't stay up too late.

Okay.

Thanks for stopping by.

Hello?

Hi.

Are you-- Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

No, it's fine. Hi.

I was just...reading a sad story. Is everything okay?

Yes, I'm-- Look, the thing is...

You need me to pick up Cody after school?

No. Colleen's gonna take him to karate with Hudson.

What about Astor's piano?

Jen's got that covered.

Look, it's social services.

There's a caseworker coming by the house this afternoon.

I should be home by 4:00, but with the buses...

I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

Thank you, Dexter.

As you all know, a night watchman from the hockey arena is missing.

Till now, we presumed he was abducted or m*rder*d by the ice-truck k*ller.

However, we searched his apartment and found a stolen surveillance tape from the night of the m*rder.

Chief of security at the hockey arena confirmed it.

The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci, the missing night watchman.

And here's the best part-- Tucci has a record.

He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Captain Matthews is coordinating with the FDLE* to launch

(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

a statewide manhunt as soon as we get clearances.

Does he drive a station wagon?

Excuse me?

Tucci-- What kind of car does he drive?

The last-known victim was seen getting in a station wagon.

I don't recall asking for any questions, Miss Morgan. Thank you.

Now, from this moment on, all our resources go to finding this man.

Your individual assignments will be coming shortly.

That's all for now.

Doesn't make sense. After being so careful for so long, why would he leave recorded evidence?

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

You sure we can't get you anything?

I'm fine.

Rita's usually home in time for the kids.

I'm just backup.

Her bus must be late.

My file says Miss Bennett's supposed to have personal transportation.

Yeah, well, she did and will again very soon.

Probably next week.

Nothing to worry about. I just have to make a note of it.

She's doing an exemplary job.

I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

So why do you keep coming around, then?

Routine follow-up for all domestic-v*olence cases.

We need to ensure a stable home environment exists.

It's a good thing. The system does work from time to time.

I was actually taken in by a wonderful family. No abuse.

In fact, my foster father understood I had special needs.

Without him...

You're lucky.

Lucky.

I'm here! Hey, everyone, I'm here.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I am lucky. What do I know about abuse?

Without the code of Harry, I'm sure I would've committed a senseless m*rder in my youth just to watch the blood flow.

Just try and keep him comfortable.

It's about all we can do for him now.

I don't understand.

A week ago, the doctor said he was getting better.

He is getting better, sweetie.

A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?

She's weird.

Listen, you two...

I'm not going to be around much longer.

Dad, don't say that.

You can make it through this if you fight.

When I'm gone, I won't be able to stop you from being who you are.

Sooner or later, you'll need to do it.

Do what?

Just remember our lessons.

What lessons? What are you talking about?

I can't make it without you.

Yes, you can.

If you feel like you're slipping...

...lean on your sister. She'll keep you connected.

f*cking forensics report.

What'd they find?

Tucci's hair and fiber.

Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.

He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?

Any word from the chem lab?

Same as the other murders.

The k*ller used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.

You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

You'd have to be a lab rat just to mess around with that sh*t.

Tucci didn't even pass high school chemistry.

Watch carefully. Right there-- see?

Right before he repositioned the torso.

He turned his head.

Like someone's giving him directions.

Someone like the ice-truck k*ller olding a m*therf*cking g*n to his back.

The k*ller's framing Tucci.

It looks that way.

Laguerta's gonna lose her sheep sh*t when she finds out.

She's gonna have to cancel her press conference.

And you know how Laguerta loves her press conferences.

Can I borrow this tape?

Bingo.

I know what happens next in this gruesome little scenario.

Jeremy is trying to re-create his first k*ll, ritualize it.

You ready?

I don't know if I want to do this, man.

What's wrong? I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

I do.

Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

Wait. Are you a p*ssy?

No.

Okay.

Where is this place, man?

It's right up here.

Come on, Jer. What are you talking about?

Don't be a b*tch.

Here we are.

I don't see it.

It's right there. See its eyes sticking out?

You have to get closer.

I still don't see it.

Really?

Maybe I was wrong.

There's no gator here, is there?

I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

Anyone see a frisbee? It flew in here somewhere.

sh*t! Let's get the f*ck out of here.

What am I doing out here?

Oh, f*ck! f*ck!

f*ck!

All I had to do was drive home, have a taco, plan my attack.

Instead, I tried to act human, like it's my job to save lives.

Code of Harry never covered this.

At least I know where Jeremy is and what I need to do.

Don't let her.

Okay, my brave little soldier.

Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

No!

Wait!

What is it, honey?

He doesn't want the shot.

Your father's very sick. He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

I want pain.

He wants pain.

I'll have to tell the doctor.

He's not going to be happy you're refusing your medication.

You can tell.

About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

...like me.

How could you tell?

She gives too much... morphine.

It's something else. It's making me worse.

She's drugging you. She's k*lling you by overdose.

Not just me. Others, too.

Stop her.

What do you mean, stop her?

It's time.

Before she hurts anyone else.

See the look on his face, like he's scared?

Like he has a g*n pointed at him?

I don't know, Debra. It's not much-- a look off-camera.

There's more. One of my Vice contacts, Gabrielle-- I trust her-- she saw the victim get into a wood-paneled wagon the night of the victim's death. That was the last time anyone saw her.

Did a background report on Tucci. He doesn't even own a car.

There's no f*cking way this guy can be the ice-truck k*ller. Sir.

What does lieutenant Laguerta say about all this?

I came straight to you, Captain.

You went around the back of your commanding officer?

Laguerta doesn't listen to me. Every time I open my mouth,...

You don't violate the chain of command. You just don't.

Now, listen, Debra. I gave you a shot in Homicide because I think you can make a halfway-decent detective.

But if I find you can't swim in these waters, I'll put you right back on the street.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

Your father never would've pulled the kind of sh*t you just did.

Did you know that one of your officers has information that casts some doubt on this manhunt of yours?

Who, Morgan?

I realize you're something of a folk hero around here, Maria, but it would be a mistake to ignore the work of a promising officer just to further your political career.

Is that what you think I'm doing?

You were a middle-of-the-pack detective before the press got ahold of you.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

It's a reality check, and you need it.

And I got it.

Let's cut to the chase. Are you telling me to call off my manhunt? 'Cause I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself signed off on it.

No...

No. You go ahead and hold your press conference, Maria.

People of this city need to know we're doing something about this mess.

But don't expect me to bail you out if that night watchman turns out to be a dead end.

A statewide manhunt is under way right now in Florida.

According to police, a night watchman is on the run after the dismembered body parts of a young South Beach woman were found Tuesday, stacked on the home ice of the Miami Blades.

The woman is believed to be the latest victim of the notorious ice-truck k*ller, now responsible for five deaths in the greater Miami area.

These terrible att*cks have to stop.

And we have to stop them.

With Tony Tucci now linked to the murders, it's our mission to find him.

f*cking joke.

Hey, going out tonight with the guys, blow off a little steam-- you in?

Hey, man, sounds good.

Pick you up at 8:00.

Elevator's around the corner and to your left.

Enjoy your stay with us.

Hello?

Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

Are you coming to pick up Astor?

Oh, no, a friend of mine is-- Denise. Is she not there?

I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

She's the last kid left here at school.

I don't have a car. Is she okay?

Yeah, she's just fine, but we can't keep her here much longer.

Okay. Okay, I'll work something out.

Do it again!

Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

Now, let's see about that splinter.

That's a deep one.

This might sting a bit.

But the magical Splinter Fairy will soon make you forget all about it.

Who's the magical Splinter Fairy?

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.

She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.

The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.

Hi, guys.

You're right, Astor.

There's no such thing as the boogeyman.

But the Splinter Fairy-- she's the real deal.

Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?

Thanks for picking her up.

If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.

Oh, sorry.

Who we picking up now, man? 'Cause he sure ain't sitting on my lap.

We're not picking up anybody, bro.

Well, what we doing in the Gables?

I told you. We're blowing off some steam. This is it.

What the hell is this?

It's a disguise.

One of Guerrero's top lieutenants-- he lives here, and we're gonna f*ck him up.

Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you wanted to go out and get sh*t-faced, man.

I am sh*t-faced.

How do I look?

Man, I'm all for sending the message, but this--

This ain't the way, man.

Why the hell not? The guy's scum.

Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

I showed my face to Guerrero.

They gonna think I'm behind this sh*t!

That's part of the plan.

What plan?

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

Open the door!

sh*t.

f*ck.

Hey, quit f*cking around. Turn on the lights.

Come on, man. Turn on the f*cking lights!

You're mine now.

What do you want?

Silence.

You gonna f*ck me, f*gg*t? 'Cause I k*lled the last guy who r*ped me.

What guy?

He r*ped you...

The guy you k*lled when you were 15?

Why didn't you tell anybody?

Would you?

He f*cked me, and I k*lled him, and if you try, I'll k*ll you, too.

I understand now.

Why didn't I see it before?

Jeremy didn't m*rder that boy four years ago.

He was taking out the garbage.

Just like I do.

Look, I really don't want to cancel all my credit cards, and I hate waiting in line at the DMV, so give me back the wallet you stole from my car, or I'll break your f*cking neck.

It's in my backpack.

Wait-- Is that all?

You want more?

That boy who r*ped you four years ago-- Did he deserve to die?

Yeah. He did.

Well, the boy the other day didn't.

Remember that. It could save your life one day.

Mr. Tinker?

Mr. Tinker, where are you?

Mr. Tinker?

Are you trapped behind the couch again, Mr. Tinker-stinker?

The nurse was my first playmate.

I'll always be grateful to her for opening up so many magnificent new doors for me.

Things were a little messy in the beginning.

Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

But I was trained well.

Those who witnessed my early stumbles never had a chance to tell.

I've just been looking through your photo album.

Hope you don't mind.

Are all your victims in here?

I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

Scream and lose a tongue.

I helped them...

All of them.

I took their pain away.

I understand.

Now it's time to take away your pain.

It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.

But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.

With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.

Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.

He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside...

...but we must maintain appearances to survive.

But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.

The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.

Sweet ride! Is it yours?

It's yours, until your mom can get a new one.

I borrowed it from impound right before auction.

Dexter...

Can we get in?

You better.

All you can do is play along at life and hope that sometimes you get it right.

Thank you.

Score one for the little wooden boy.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood. What a gorgeous idea.

Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold environment... to slow the flow of blood.

I suppose I should be upset, but I'm not.

In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind of like, "Hey, want to play?"

Kara, it's me. It's James.

You just opened a dangerous door.

No, man. You did... when you m*rder*d a cop and an innocent lady.

Was Kara sleeping with someone other than Ricky?

Was it you?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Going out tonight with the guys, blow off steam. You in?

Hey, man. Sounds good.

I thought you said you wanted to go get sh*t-faced.

I am sh*t-faced.

I showed my face to Guerrero, to his whole church.

They're gonna think I'm behind this sh*t.

You f*cked my sister. You f*cked a cop's wife.

Now you're just f*cked, buddy.

He's escalating the thrill, posing his victim in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see, to show us what he's capable of doing.

What did I miss?

Fingertips.

f*ckin' as*h*le, that's my girl.

This body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck k*ller.

Bullshit.

Of course I agree with my sister, but unlike her, I'm not upset.

He's still out there, and I'm waiting... breathless.

I find people around me are always making some kind of connection, like friendship or romance, but human bonds always lead to messy complications... commitment, sharing, driving people to the airport.

Besides, if I let someone get that close,

So, time to put on my mask.

I need your expertise.

I live to serve.

Excuse us, fellas.

Interesting hand job.

That's funny.

It is?

So, how long you think it's been there?

This feels familiar.

Okay. So, how long has it been there?

Blood stopped pooling, still wet... couple hours at the most.

What time was it found?

A jogger called it in this morning about 7:30.

No prints. Wiped clean. Real creep show, huh?

Any sign of the rest of the body?

Just Mr. Hand. Do you think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

It's hard to say. There's blood. That's different.

Plus, it's a male victim-- haven't seen that before.

The cut appears to be almost delicate.

You see between the first and second row of carpals...

Very surgical.

Check out what else he left behind.

A little postcard to remember him by.

How far is Rand Beach from here?

This is Rand Beach.

It was renamed Petrie Beach a few years ago.

Okay, everybody.

Everybody say "stinky feet".

Stinky feet!

Wait. Nobody move. Dexter, were you smiling?

No.

Okay, we'll do another one.

This time, everybody smiles. You, too, Dex.

Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.

Shut your damn face, Deb.

Hey, language, please.

What? She always talks like that.

Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.

What's your problem?

I hate the beach.

It's sandy and gross and nasty, and I want to go home.

Too bad. You're part of a family.

And being part of a family means smiling for photos.

Why should I pretend I'm happy?

Because it'll make your mom happy, and because it's how you fit in.

Remember we talked about that?

Yeah.

This is how you do it.

When somebody takes your picture, you smile.

It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

You just do it to fit in. Okay?

Okay.

All right.

Come here, handsome.

Okay. Everybody ready? One more time.

Stinky feet!

Yeah, I just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs.

Straight to the station after, yeah. Thanks, lieutenant.

Dexter Morgan, this is your life.

It is my new friend-- The ice-truck k*ller.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me... my life... my secrets.

...have even brought in manpower from other counties in an effort to expedite the search.

Officially, Mr. Tucci has not been charged with any crime...

Then tell the f*cking governor to free up funds for overtime.

I mean the more guys I got out there, the sooner we find Tucci.

Kelly, I'll get back to you.

What's wrong?

Fingerprint I. D. came back on that hand from the beach.

It belongs to Tony Tucci, your ice-truck k*ller suspect.

What?

Wait a minute.

No. No, no, no. No way.

No way! I mean, this--

This has to be a mistake!

The mistake, Maria, was unleashing a high-profile manhunt before you had all the facts.

f*ck!

Okay. This doesn't mean that Tucci is not the k*ller.

Don't!

Just... just don't.

You wanted to be on tv-- well, get ready... 'cause the press will annihilate us for this.

We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

All right.

You go talk to that woman. Do your mea culpas.

If we handle this right, maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

Tom!

I'm the last person she wants to see.

I called her son a k*ller!

And now's your chance to make it right.

So Laguerta screwed the pooch on this one, huh?

I'm taking point.

You can help by getting all non essentials off the beach.

Secure and separate any witnesses, all right?

Will do. What did the Captain say? Did he make her cry?

Just control the f*cking beach, Angel.

I knew Tucci wasn't the k*ller. I knew it.

Laguerta whipped up a manhunt for a rent-a-cop.

Man, I wish I could have been there to see the Captain rip her a new one.

Morgan, calm down.

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

You see all these people over here?

Yeah.

What are they?

Potential witnesses.

And what do we do with potential witnesses, Morgan?

We-- we interview them. Got it.

Where is he...

The rest of him?

We're-- we're still looking.

The entire force is looking. We're making every effort.

Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

Yes.

I'm afraid so.

Mrs. Tucci...

I said some very harsh things about your son.

Thank you. "Thank you"? For what?

For coming to tell me in person.

For God's sake, please.

There's nothing more important than this.

Can you find my son's body?

If it's the last thing I do.

I made a grave...

Bring him home, please.

I just want to bury my son.

I do love Halloween.

What's inside of a pumpkin?

See for yourself.

You don't like this stuff? I do. Come on. Get in there.

I'll finish cleaning this out. You can carve it tomorrow.

There he is again, mom.

My god. It's every night now.

That dog? Where's it coming from?

Next door-- My neighbor's.

Leaves the poor thing in the yard all day and night.

It's been getting worse. I mean, I would talk to her, but I don't want to start something.

Listen to him, mom. He's so sad.

I just wish he would shut up so I could sleep.

Do you want me to talk to her?

No, you don't have to do that.

I insist.

Hello. I don't think we've met.

Boyfriend of the blonde next door. I've seen you around.

Look, I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

That's precisely why I'm here.

We can't help but notice your dog, uh, cries... a lot.

I know. My ex moved out and left his dog.

Trust me, I wish there was something I could do.

You could, uh, take him inside.

Walter's an outside dog.

You put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.

He doesn't like being inside.

Did he tell you that?

We'd really appreciate it if you could find a way to keep him quiet.

The kids are upset.

Maybe that's 'cause they think their crackhead father is gonna come back and beat their asses again.

You know what works for me? Earplugs.

I could make things so much easier for Rita... but that would be wrong.

I love Halloween-- the one time of year when everyone wears a mask... not just me.

People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster.

Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

Brother, friend, boyfriend... All part of my costume collection.

Some people might call me a fraud.

OK. Let's see if it will fit.

You stabbed me in the back!

I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.

They're so excited.

Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for an entire day.

Who wouldn't love that?

What about a costume for you? Maybe this one?

No. No. I think I'll be Snow White again. It's kind of tradition.

Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

Just like your mom-- Two perfect princesses.

Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.

No way. I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

I keep telling him that a rugby shirt is not a costume.

Another photo from my family album.

He's re-creating my past with Tony Tucci's body parts.

He's forcing me to see this.

Nobody paying you to stand around and g*dd*mn stare.

I thought Angel was working this case, Sergeant.

Sergeant?

Friends of yours?

Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

The foot was severed between the tarsus and the metatarsus.

The wound is circular-- again, almost surgical.

And there's blood. Guy gives us body after body with no blood.

Why he's making a switch now?

He's trying to send a message...

One that's more important than his ritual need to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

Okay, so what's the message?

I'm not sure.

Well, who's he sending it to?

I can't tell you that, either.

What f*cking good are you?

No f*cking good at all, apparently.

You okay?

He's mocking me.

Don't take it personally. Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

Who?

Relax, bro.

Sorry.

I need to bag this photo under the ball. Do you mind?

He knows.

He's not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth.

He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

Come on, Simon. You want it? It's right there.

Over there. Oh, yeah.

Guys, give it back!

Come on, Simon.

All right. Enough. Get out of here.

What the hell is going on?

We're just having fun.

It didn't look like Simon was having too much fun.

You're always telling me to fit in, and I'm just trying to be part of the team.

You can't be a bully, Dexter.

First of all it's wrong.

Secondly, people remember bullies.

People like me-- cops.

A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

So...

Blend in.

Go on.

Officer Morgan, I have an assignment for you.

Yeah, I heard we found a foot this morning.

You want me to head out to the crime scene?

No.

Look, we pulled these from security cameras around the beach...

Stores, hotels, ATMs.

I want you to check every frame.

You are sh1tting me.

If we're lucky, we can see the ice-truck k*ller coming and going.

We have techs who can do this.

Not all techs have the skill to spot suspicious activity.

I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

And keep your eye out for another box of surveillance tapes.

It's on its way from the new crime scene.

Hey, Doakes, what's up? f*ck anyone's wife lately?

Thanks to your little chickenshit stunt, Guerrero's guys are tailing me everywhere I go. Did you know that?

That's not good, James. You should alert the police...

Unless, of course, for some reason the officers of Miami metro wouldn't want to help you... like, you know, you f*cked one of their wives.

You think this is a joke.

I'm gonna end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

You should have thought of that before you stuck your d*ck in my sister.

You're right.

I should have waited until the divorce came through.

Bullshit.

What? She didn't tell you?

She filed the papers, jackass.

You don't believe me, ask the Captain.

He tried to pull Ricky out of his assignment, but Ricky didn't want to come out.

Of course not. His job was to bring down Guerrero.

It was his job to protect his wife.

Ricky's the m*therf*cker who got her k*lled.

You backed the wrong cop, as*h*le.

Let's go, guys. Time for school.

Guys? Come on.

You don't want to be in the Halloween parade?

Shut up!

Shut up! Just--

I need to talk to you about your dog.

I talked to your boyfriend.

My kids are exhausted.

All right, when it comes to my kids, I stop being nice.

So I need you to bring him in at night, feed him on a schedule, and take him for some exercise every now and...

I'm sorry. Is this funny?

No, no, no It's... it's sad.

But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.

There's nothing you can do.

The cops will tell me to keep him quiet, and I'll say I will, and then they'll leave, and he'll go back to doing what he does.

But you're funny.

Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't place much value in blending in.

He wants me to see who he is and what he does.

Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

What does that make me?

Crap.

You okay, man?

No.

Hey, don't let this bastard get to you.

You're the best blood expert in the state, and we need you to stay with this, my friend.

I'll be all right.

Wait. Before you get back to work, check this out.

What is that, a butterfly?

No, socio, it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

I'm...

I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary tomorrow night.

Congratulations. How many years?

10 years she's been my lucky charm now.

Tin is the traditional gift, but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

No. It's probably a good plan. Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

This can't be right.

What's up?

You see that? You see it?

I don't know. What do I see?

The blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping when it was severed.

Mean son of a b*tch, no doubt.

But look at the foot. It's the same blood flow, plus the lividity. Look, it's the same bruising, same ashen color, same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it.

But... we found them a day apart.

I know.

Dios santo.

L. T., you got to listen to him.

It's the guard, Tucci... I think he's alive.

What are you talking about?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

Tucci's alive?

Both limbs were taken from a live body, and we found them 24 hours apart. That's not all.

Tell them, Dexter.

If the hand came off yesterday at 7:00 A.M. and the foot this morning at 7:00...

We get another body part first thing tomorrow.

But he's alive.

Put together a task force. I want all available personnel on this, and put a priority status on all forensics related to this case.

Captain Matthews, please. Have him call me back immediately.

Mrs. Tucci?

Maria Laguerta.

I have some amazing news for you.

We believe your son is alive.

No. No. We haven't, but I promise we will.

No, thank you.

Yes. Yes. Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

We've got a live body now, people.

We want to find Tucci while he's still breathing.

That means trying to figure out where tomorrow's drop is so we catch our man in the act. Any ideas?

Don't forget the photos. They're new.

Thank you, officer Morgan. We're doing just fine out here.

Why do we think he's taking photos?

He wants to be remembered.

You use photos to record memories.

I almost feel sorry for them, trying to put together a puzzle when they don't know pieces are missing from the box...

...pieces he gave me.

He wants me to play the game his way.

Okay, what else could it be?

Change.

You got something to say, speak up.

The beach changed names.

The office park used to be a soccer field.

He's dumping the body parts in places that used to be something else.

Okay. Places that have changed. Let's make a list, assign surveillance to each location for the morning.

South beach used to be a mangrove swamp.

Homestead park was originally an air force base, right?

They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

Thank you, officer Morgan.

The whole city of Miami reinvents itself every 5 years.

Then we'll stay up all night until our list is complete. "I once was lost "But now I'm found, "Was blind but now I see".

Lieutenant.

Anything?

Well, I am so glad you could make it.

Well, I just came by to show my support.

It's been a long time since I've been to church.

Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

I would like to introduce you to someone very special.

This is Maria Laguerta. She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

Not just me. Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

You brought us all here together by giving us hope.

May the Lord bless you and guide you, Maria.

This is Saint Anthony, patron Saint of The lost.

Find him.

I tried to apologize, but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

And you wanted to apologize why?

You don't think I should, the way I went after her son?

Yeah, you did f*ck that up.

Yeah. I crucified him without having all the facts.

I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

I need to let her know that I'm sorry. I need to tell her.

Who is that gonna make feel better, you or her?

Leave that woman alone with her candles and "kumbaya".

So, where we at?

I added additional patrols at Dolphin Stadium, Bayside marketplace, and Casa Casuarina.

That's everybody we have out in the field--

Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol. So what's next?

What's next is you should go home.

You've had the sh*t kicked out of you all day.

I like it here with you.

You're the only person people hate more than me.

Come on. Let's both get out of here.

Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

Officer Morgan.

Call me on my cellphone if you find anything.

Son of a b*tch.

f*ck this.

What?

Want a piece of me?

f*cking as*h*le!

I will pay you $1 million if you help me figure out where the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.

It's like it's staring me right in the face, but--

$1 million.

You don't have $1 million.

I'll steal it from evidence.

I've been stuck in a g*dd*mn fishbowl all day.

I want to be part of the hunt.

I'm almost off duty.

Sorry, sister.

$2 million. I know you made a list of locations.

Just pick your favorite spot. We'll stake it out together.

My favorite spot. Of course.

Come on. I want to play.

Deb, I got to go. We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

I used to love this place-- The bulldozers pressing garbage, layer after layer, right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it. I found it soothing.

But it wasn't condos back then.

This has to be the right place.

So what am I missing?

Sorry about that. Go back to sleep.

Hello.

Mr. Morgan? Dispatch.

You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

Do you need the address?

No, I know exactly where it is.

Are you okay?

Are you kidding? That was awesome.

You've got some hay in your hair.

Where?

Right there!

Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

You'll miss these moments when they're older.

Thanks.

It's great to see you having such a good time, Dex.

Are you kidding me? This hay's giving me a total allergy attack, and we're going around in circles on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

Ready?

Smile!

What do we have?

Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

You think Tucci's still alive?

If he is, he won't be for long.

Unless you're toting a portable DVD player, you better be finished watching that security footage.

I am on break. I'm on my own time.

So you are, but your shift starts in two hours.

So if I were you, I'd head back to the station.

Traffic at this hour's a b*tch.

Speaking of b*tch...

Didn't dad bring us here once when we were kids?

I don't remember.

Hey, Dexter, come here. Take a look at this.

Excuse us.

She's right, you know, about the traffic.

It's interesting. There's no sign of infection where the foot was cut off, like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics before amputating.

At least he's looking after his patient.

Hey, check this out.

Is this appropriate?

It's our anniversary... and it's the big one.

Nina deserves the best. "Ox"?

No. f*ck!

What's the matter with you? It's x's and o'S.

Like tic-tac-toe?

No, like "hugs and kisses".

Diamond-filled hugs and kisses in a white-gold setting.

Well, that's good, 'cause you wouldn't want it to look like someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

g*dd*mn it.

Where's mom?

She had to run a few errands before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

I heard you two were up a lot last night.

It was that damn dog.

Hey, Code, grown-up language is for grown-ups.

I don't think that dog will be bothering you anymore.

How do you know?

My mystic powers told me.

Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

All right, tell you what-- I'll make you a deal.

When you become a rock star, you can swear, too.

Walter! Walter!

You're right. He's gone.

Where's my dog?! What did you do with it?!

All right. Here he is.

Just remember to walk him, feed him, and love him, okay?

My nieces are shy sometimes. Girls, say thank you to Rita.

Thank you.

They already made a doggy bed-- sweaters, towels.

It actually looks more comfortable than my bed.

I knew this would be a perfect fit.

You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

Harry was the only one who saw me...

...really saw me...

So he taught me to hide.

That's what's kept me safe.

But sometimes, I'm not sure where Harry's vision of me ends and the real me starts.

If I'm just a collection of learned behaviors... bits and pieces of Harry... maybe my new friend is right.

Maybe I am a fraud.

Hi.

Hey.

Where's Astor and Cody?

They're passed out in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

Can I come in?

Yeah, sure. Sorry.

I should warn you, I haven't really been myself lately.

Maybe I can cheer you up.

Trick or treat.

You look great.

Who are you?

Lara Croft. "Tomb Raider".

You raid tombs dressed like that? That's impressive.

What happened to Snow White?

Well, I'm-- I'm sick of her.

You know, I never did get to thank you for picking the kids up for me.

You took care of your "errand"?

Yes.

The beagle has landed happily in the arms of two loving girls.

You are a superhero.

It was such an incredible feeling rescuing that dog.

You upset your neighbor.

f*ck her.

Well, I guess you're used to dealing with people like her, right?

Considerably worse.

Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

There's a case I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

Maybe I can help.

No. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm a dognapper now... and a tomb raider.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

I've come to appreciate the comfortable moments with Rita...

The easy, quiet moments--

This...

...might be better.

Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another bucket of fried chicken.

Where's your brother?

I'm not his keeper.

What do you think of this?

It's an anniversary present for Nina.

See, it's... it's a diamond key to my heart.

It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.

You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is. That's it. That's what I like.

And I'm not gonna take it back.

It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

Really?

I would.

How... How do I look? Like the tie?

Angel.

Happy anniversary, baby.

You know you can't just walk in here anymore.

I just thought...

...our anniversary...

Maybe tonight we could put all that behind us.

It doesn't matter what night it is.

I told you I need time.

It's been three months, baby.

How much time do you need?

Don't turn this around on me, Angel...

...Not after what you did.

I need as much time as I need.

Angel...

As long as you're here, you want to see Aury?

Lo siento, princesa.

Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento.

Thank you.

That was...

...unexpected.

Yeah. For me, too.

I have no problem with... unexpected.

No, you... certainly don't.

I have to get back to the kids.

What are these?

I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

Look how cute you are.

And your dad-- such a nice face, just like you.

I was adopted.

I know.

But you're both good men. I can tell.

Very poetic.

Poetic? It's a water fountain.

Well, yeah, but look at the way your dad took the photo.

His shadow's on the wall right next to you.

It's like he's always with you.

I'd frame this one.

All this time the answer was right here.

Harry... photographer and foster father extraordinaire.

He is always with me, and he's the common denominator.

Rita... you're a genius.

All those years of smiling for the camera...

It was empty and fake, the pictures meaningless, until now.

Pictures of Harry.

So this is it.

It's cool.

Cool.

Dexter, this is the place where my father, your grandfather, worked for 30 years.

He started out as the janitor, worked his way up to chief of maintenance.

This place put food on our table.

In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.

I know.

Excuse me, miss! Miss?

Would you mind?

Oh, come on, dad.

Hey, you all right?

It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

I'm sorry, miss. It's okay. Thanks.

We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

Yeah, we are.

Dex, I really don't feel like doing this now.

Don't be a baby--

Being part of a family means smiling for family photos, right?

My friend left this.

He's showing me where to go.

Am I going because it's what he wants or because that's what Harry would want?

What do I want?

The hospital's shut down now, abandoned for years, but tonight it's visiting hours again.

Well, James...

Why did you have to be such a pain in the a*s, huh?

f*ck!

I didn't tell you you could get up.

Please, please.

Now you get up.

You traumatize my little girl in church... break the knees of my best turner.

You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

The only thing to do with a wild dog...

Police! Hands in the air!

Thought you could use backup.

You could have filled me in, man. sh*t.

Got you going after a g*dd*mn cop, m*therf*cker.

We own your a*s now.

So this was the plan all along...

To use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

Yeah, and now my sister can rest in peace.

We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

Get this piece of sh*t out of here.

Please.

Just do it.

k*ll me.

I'm ready.

Just don't cut me anymore.

Please don't cut me anymore.

Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

Tools at the ready.

Just k*ll me. It's okay.

He was left here so I would k*ll him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.

I can't k*ll this man.

Harry wouldn't want it.

And neither would I.

Are you Morgan?

Message came through dispatch for you.

Who left this?

Who left it?!

Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

Try a hug once in a while.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

I'm just the one who got the call, Sir.

But you followed it up.

Right place at the right time, Sir.

Where we at?

Morgan's tip was good.

They're taking Tucci over to county.

Alive?

Alive.

So, I suppose this gets Deb off of surveillance-tape duty.

Really? Is that what you suppose?

I got your page, Lieutenant.

Doakes is caught up in the Guerrero bust.

You're taking point here.

You got it.

I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow. I want forensic evidence.

I don't care if you have to tear apart this building brick by brick.

Entiende?

Si.

Use Morgan here.

How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

Oh, you were right. She loved it.

You nailed that one.

Everyone hides who they are, at least some of the time.

Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded it's there at all.

Good work, man. I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether.

And what about me?

Maybe I'll never be the human Harry wanted me to be.

But I couldn't k*ll Tony Tucci.

That's not me, either.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

So I'm neither man nor beast.

I'm something new entirely, with my own set of rules.

I'm Dexter.Previously on "Dexter"...

Think this is our guy's work?

The ice-truck k*ller?

Laguerta insulted the real k*ller's intelligence, and now he's getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy.

It's the guard-- Tucci.

I think he's alive.

Tucci's alive?

The ice-truck k*ller is keeping him alive to perform amputations.

He's sending me a message.

He wants me to go there.

Please.

He was left here so I would k*ll him.

Just k*ll me.

I can't k*ll this man.

Taking Tucci over to County alive.

I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan, but you are my up-and-comer.

You saved a man's life tonight.

The thing that surprises me most about Rita is how much I like being with her.

There's all sorts of things I can do.

What-- what are you doing?

Whatever I want.

My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist the k*ll he left for me, but I did.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be. I'm Dexter.

I like to pretend I'm alone, completely alone, maybe post-apocalypse or plague, Whatever-- No one left to act normal for, no need to hide who I really am.

It would be

...freeing.

Stop grinning like a f*cking psycho and get back to work.

Sorry, sergeant.

I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before I tear the bed apart.

I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

My shadow companion chose this place well.

This was his sanctuary, for a while, at least.

All these people pawing over it seems...

He was here for days, playing with sharp objects.

I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless, amazingly so.

The only blood I found belongs to the security guard.

Has he said anything yet?

Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

Lieutenant, up here!

There's got to be something here. Find it.

The guy's not a ghost. Tony Tucci is evidence of that.

Hey, Dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet?

It's like sh**ting a Jackson Pollock.

Well, your Jackson Pollock is in the bag.

Ready?

Okay.

What was that?

Did you see that?

What?

Damn rats.

We're all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their sh*t in the dust.

We'll be coughing up blood, skin lesions, mouth sores.

Lovely. Can we get the lights, guys?

You ever heard of rat-bite fever?

Masuka, what'd I say about the f*cking rats?

You haven't found anything, won't find anything.

This is a bust, right?

In so many words.

Which means I'm just jerking off till Tucci wakes up.

So take a break. You've been working this thing 24-7.

Or are you still avoiding a personal life?

Oh, f*ck you.

And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.

Thanks, guys.

It doesn't have to be either/or.

Maybe not for you.

If I found someone, so can you, right?

Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

Tell me about it.

Yelina? Are you okay?

I'm sorry. I'm fine.

Ernesto hasn't arrived?

I'm sure he'll be here soon.

No.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Coyote?

You mean the man you paid to bring him here?

He said he sent Ernesto back to Cuba.

But that was a week ago, and no one in Cárdenas has heard from Ernesto.

Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

...This was his number, but it's not working anymore.

I was supposed to leave him money in a park.

Listen, my boyfriend works for the police. I'm sure he--

No, no, no. We can't go to the police.

He said he'd hurt my family in Cuba.

No, it's okay. It's okay. Dexter will know what to do.

I feel just terrible for her.

And they were supposed to be married after he got here.

I do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues.

I can talk to him.

That's really kind of you, Dex.

I mean, can you imagine not knowing if your fiancée is dead or alive?

Uh, no.

Every night after work Yelina goes across the street, to the beach.

I've seen her there, just... staring out at the water, willing him to walk out of it.

Have you ever longed for anything like that?

She wants something from me. Ever since the blow job, she assumes we've taken it to the next level.

She doesn't know yet-- I don't have a next level.

Well, when I was a kid, I would have k*lled for an Atari.

You know?

Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man...

It always comes to this once sex is introduced.

Small talk no longer cuts it.

Eventually she'll call me a science project and slam the door in my face.

But when do you think he'll wake up?

Yeah, I did call an hour ago, but there's a k*ller out there that's into whores and security guards, but I'll bet nurses are next.

Yo, check you, all "MPD Blue".

Shanda, what are you doing here?

You have another lead on the ice-truck k*ller?

Man, I got bigger worries than that sick sh*t.

Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?

I'm not springing your pimp, if that's what you're after.

Oh, hell, no.

But my landlord's another f*cking story--

Trying to kick me out of my home.

Shanda.

He got no cause, except he's a born-again hypocrite m*therf*cker.

Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?

No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.

Morgan. Found this in evidence.

Masuka was gonna grease it through.

A cigarette butt?

Jesus, we could pull DNA off of that, or even a print.

Except it would be your print.

You were smoking on a crime scene.

Not on the crime scene-- like on the way-far end of the park.

The whole area's a crime scene. You should know that by now.

Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

Who the f*ck is that?

Give it a rest, Shanda.

Morgan, go do something useful.

Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

And do not talk to him without me!

Believe me-- your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

No, she's a maid. She's not my maid.

So, have you heard of any other Cuban immigrants disappearing?

A few.

The poor b*stards. They spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold, puke the whole 90 miles to Miami.

Then they get here, thinking, "I'm an American. I'm free".

Except the damn coyote...

He won't let them go till his family comes up with a surprise release fee.

If they can't pay...

They disappear.

Freedom's just another word for one more way to get f*cked.

Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

You have any suspects?

Sure, four or five, mostly Cubans themselves, but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

If warrants were applied for, their names will be in the database.

Look, buddy... I know you want to help out your maid, but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

You'd be surprised.

Jorge Castillo-- number 3 on the department's list of suspects, but the only one even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

They never got enough evidence for a search warrant, but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

No neighbors, no foot traffic

-- It's promising.

A good place for human trafficking... or worse.

Excuse me. Private yard.

I'm just praying you have a '69

Stingray headlight somewhere in here.

Dave Cutler.

Castillo. I'm sorry, but I don't.

Man, my restoration's almost done. She's a beauty.

I don't do individual sales, Mr. Cutler, but I can give you the name of a Corvette shop I deal with.

I'll be happy to look around myself.

No offense, man, but I can't take my phone orders if I'm watching over my merchandise.

You run this whole place alone?

Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

You know what? Try Wexler's, out in Tamarac.

That's my vette guy. Yeah.

Must be nice being your own boss--

Get out in the water whenever you want.

I saw that floater on your key chain. I got to get one of those.

Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

I do a little fishing. I got a 32-foot Concept. What about you?

I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

I don't speak Spanish, sir.

Sorry. I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

He's on heavy sedatives at the moment. I think he deserves them.

I'll wait.

Hey.

Mr. Tucci.

Tony.

I'm gonna find this c*cksucker.

I swear.

I don't understand America's obsession with cars.

I can just imagine squeezing Rita and the kids into that thing and hitting the open road-- Cramped quarters, public bathrooms, hours of nothing but conversation.

It's someone's American dream

-- my nightmare.

This must be where Castillo locks them up.

But if he's k*lling them when they can't pay, he's not doing it here.

So where are they?

Dexter Morgan.

Gerard here.

There's a floater down in South Beach morgue.

Could be a match for your maid's fiancé.

She's a maid. She's not my--

Is it all right if I bring her down?

The sooner, the better.

Okay, then. Thanks. Have a good day.

Tonight at the Salsa Room.

You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

Blow it off. I'm buying.

Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

I can't deal with

800 anonymous tips.

I'm working on it.

Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

Sexy.

Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro. It's you and me.

I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

I wonder if it'd work on Rita.

Dexter Morgan-- I called earlier.

Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

Yeah.

Hey, Jerry, can you take these guys around back?

Should I?

Nah, I'll go with her. She might need a shoulder.

She senses I'm not a shoulder.

Bad sign-- She's catching on.

I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

If you ask me, man, it's Darwin's theory at work.

That must be what love looks like.

The inability to feel has its advantages...

...sometimes.

Hey, Dexter.

Hey, Mindy.

Do you need any help?

No.

So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

Why would I want to do that?

She wanted you to ask her to the dance, Dexter.

That's not what she said.

Well, you have to learn their signals.

Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

I just like being alone.

But most normal people don't, and it's important that you seem normal.

Even though I'm not.

Because you're not.

We'll start you off with a temporary prefab and then make adjustments as we go.

Rudy here's gonna put me back together again, good as new.

Half the battle is attitude, and you have a great one.

Well, I'm alive.

I didn't see that happening, but here I am.

Yo, pretty boy, you're stealing my thunder, and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

I don't know.

I just might have to fight you for this one.

Okay, we'll arm-wrestle later. Now get out of here.

Watch out for this guy. He's a dog.

Excuse me.

I know what you need, guys, but I didn't see much.

Well, any detail will help, Mr. Tucci.

Well... He came up on me from behind, and he wore a mask when he made me put the... the... the things on the ice.

Gosh... I'll get it.

Angel of mercy. Just how merciful are you?

You are a dog, aren't you?

So the ladies tell me.

Can you tell us how tall he was or if he was black, white, latino?

White, I think. I'm guessing maybe average height--

Not fat, not thin, just... average.

I don't know.

And when he started, you know, working on me, I was blindfolded, so...

Did you hear anything?

Did he have an accent or anything?

He didn't talk much, or he'd whisper.

And that's all you heard?

Except the rats.

Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed, and I'd have to shake them off.

Some crap-a*s witness I am, huh?

You're doing fine. You've given us a lot.

Yeah?

You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something, I close my eyes.

Really?

We could even blindfold you again.

...I'm kind of tired right now.

It's okay. Get some rest. Officer Morgan and I are leaving.

Alone.

No pretending. No hiding.

No time to relax. I'm too close.

Jorge Castillo is bad. That I know.

But bad enough to have k*lled Yelina's fiancé?

That I have to prove.

Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

Yeesh-- new money.

Normal people dream of this--

A new car, a big home, a boat at the reef shore marina... and a beautiful wife.

Too bad-- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

They're so happy.

She has no clue who she's with.

Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.

Mr. Perry, you were on the grounds of the same hospital where we found Mr. Tucci. And you were alone that night?

It was just me and Caesar, my dog.

He likes abandoned buildings. Caesar's a ratter.

What did this guy do?

Why? Does he look familiar?

Yes, he looks like an actor from that John Singleton movie.

What was that?

How about you focus on whether or not he was the man you saw at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

Well, it was difficult to tell. It was dark.

You said you got a look at him.

He had a cap.

Hey, is that KG-230 hooked into a digital CCTB network?

Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

You get better resolution with the 440. Hello.

We're done here.

Give me a minute.

Morgan, thank Mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

Christ on a crutch, he could tell us something.

Sergeant Doakes says he is a looky-loo.

We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

Now do me a favor-- Get him out of my precinct. Thank you.

You could try being a little more optimistic.

I mean, if Tony Tucci can be optimistic, I think we can.

You might get more out of people.

How do you know Perry doesn't know anything?

Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

Okay.

This case is getting colder every minute you waste on bullshit like Perry.

And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

What the f*ck were you thinking?

Tucci's closed for business now, and you shut him down.

I... I was trying a new approach.

Maybe you should just learn the basics before you reinvent the damn wheel.

Come on. How can you not dance to this?

It's a gift.

We just need some more patrón, compadre.

Another round!

No more for me. I got to get up early-- K*llers to catch.

Forget that. The night's just beginning, right, ladies?

Yes!

Ladies, excuse us. Angel, come here.

Your wife-- She's probably worrying.

I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

She don't mind who I flirt with as long as I bring home la pasion.

La pasión?

Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

What about... communication, trust?

La pasión.

Wait.

What if she wants something more?

Then you reciprocate-- You know... La pasión.

No, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

Don't go down that emotional road. Just go down on her.

It's easier, and she'll be distracted.

Come on. Let's dance, Angel.

So...

What do you want to do now?

Dance with her, Dexter. Be polite.

Get her punch. Open the door for her.

And if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic--

Dad, I've kissed a girl before.

You have?

Yeah.

And?

I don't know, it was okay.

Dexter, women are different from men.

We've had this talk, dad.

I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

When they're with someone, physically, they feel connected.

And they know when you're not.

They can sense it because you're very exposed.

Yeah, you're naked.

I mean emotionally.

Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

I can fake it.

Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

This is a tough one.

Is this it?

Angel, I've only been here one time. I don't remember.

Wake up.

Your wife's gonna love me.

The problem with acting normal is normal people get into stupid situations like this.

You scared the hell out of me.

Sorry, Nina.

I'm Dexter. You remember? I work with Angel down at the station.

What are you doing here?

It's funny. We were out celebrating Angel's pay-grade bump.

He got a raise?

Yeah.

Well, as you can see, he...

...had a little too much to drink, so I gave him a ride home.

He doesn't live here anymore.

We're separated.

So... good night.

Oh, okay.

Good night.

La pasión.

Angel.

Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

I guess I had one too many, huh?

And then about 10 more.

How did I end up here?

You don't remember?

So you live here, huh?

I live here.

You're kind of neat, aren't you?

Bad habit instilled by mom.

We better get going.

Pressure's on with this ice-truck-k*ller situation.

Yeah. You go ahead. I'll lock up.

I have to stop by home anyway.

My wife's gonna be worried. She gets so hot and bothered, you know women.

No, I'll just wait, and I'll drop you at your car.

Where's your bathroom?

Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one pretending to be normal.

I found hair on this one that doesn't belong to Tucci--

Rat hair.

I probably picked up a parasite just--

Don't test me, Masuka.

You see all that shredding?

Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

They took evidence away from the crime scene?

Exactly.

So we check their nest.

Wild goose chase, without knowing what we're looking for.

We could talk to Tucci again.

He knows more than he thinks, and my gut tells me he can take it. 'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

Masuka, run the sheet. See if we can trace it to manufacturer.

I've got court in the morning, so call me on my cell--

All right, I get it. I'm a newbie.

But you are old and tired, and you need new eyes on this.

So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

And don't you f*cking say a word, Masuka.

How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

You drop them in the middle of the ocean, tell them to swim for shore?

You can't hide for long, Jorge.

Hello?

Dexter, it's me.

Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

The morgue.

Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

I'm sure he'll get what he deserves. How are you doing?

Still a little shaky.

I have some late-night work I have to do, but I could stop by earlier... if you want.

Maybe we could rent a movie.

Yeah, I'll pick up a DVD--

Something light.

Maybe if I don't blink, my eyes will tear up.

I hate this.

I'm questioning every move. It's exhausting.

I should just break it off already, unless I can pacify her, give her something, Reciprocate.

La pasion.

Dexter?

I'm sorry. I...

I was just...

You were so generous with me.

I was gonna... return the favor.

No, that's very sweet, but...

Sorry, I'm just not in the mood for... that.

That you, Dex?

Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

It's okay, son. You must have been having fun.

No, I pretended to.

That's good, Dexter.

Dad?

Do you think that maybe one day I'll... you know, feel it... for real?

I hope so, son.

I really do.

Alone, I'd be better off.

Relationships are too confusing.

But this I can figure out.

This I do well.

Jorge Castillo's boat. If he's a k*ller, then there's proof.

There's always proof, and I'll find it.

Happy and in love...

The perfect couple.

I wonder if Rita and the kids would like fishing.

Focus.

If one of these matches the contact number for Ernesto's coyote, you're it, Jorge.

He drowns them here, then dumps them out there.

If they wash up, it'll be chalked up to another inner-tube mishap.

Yep--

This I do well.

Think about his shoes.

Did he walk with a limp?

Did he move smoothly, like an athlete?

Try to remember, Tony, for me.

I would if I could, hon.

You're a sweet lady, and smart-- using your charms on me.

No, no, I don't mind.

It's probably the last time a woman will flirt with me, looking like this.

It's okay, Tony. Maybe later.

We should try the blindfold.

What?

I.. don't want to do that.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tucci.

I... can't even begin to imagine what you've been through, but it's our job to make sure that nobody else goes through it, too.

So, Morgan, you're up.

He was hard to hear. I never knew where he was.

So he's agile. That's good, Tony. What else did you hear?

Rats. Always those damn rats.

Try to focus on him, Tony.

What did you hear? What did you smell?

Menthol.

Menthol?

Yeah, like cough drops.

He cleared his throat a lot. You know, like--

He unwrapped them.

I could hear those wrappers, that crinkly sound.

And he sucked on them.

I could hear them clicking against his... teeth when he...

The son of a b*tch loved those f*cking lozenges.

Nothing in this nest.

Well, check another floor. They're all over this dump.

f*ck this.

Masuka.

We got another one over here.

Promising. Several fragments from the sheet here.

These rat b*stards were repeat customers.

Who had garlic for lunch?

I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

Actually...

I think you're gonna French me.

...2934. I like being right.

I usually am, about these things. "Be prepared"-- It's my motto.

The boy scouts and I have that in common.

Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

What are we looking at?

They found the ice-truck k*ller's lozenge wrapper, thanks to your sister.

Lozenge wrapper?

Hey, after two months of finding f*ck all in this case, a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

My favorite serial k*ller is a lozenge eater.

How human of him.

We have a partial.

Partial print-- A partial f*cking print!

Proud of you, sis.

Hey, it's a celebration here. Where are you going?

Crime scene.

Excuse me.

What's, uh-- What's going on?

We've got our first piece of tangible evidence on the ice-truck k*ller.

A partial f*cking print.

You run it through AFIS yet?

It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

He gets pulled in for something, anything, we got him.

We get it photoed before we scan it.

And I want Label to ID the point of comparison before you do the AFIS hit.

Masuka, I want that being swabbed for DNA.

And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

You never know. We might get lucky again.

It wasn't luck. Good work, Morgan.

Afuera, va. Muevanse. Come on.

Come on! Entrar, entrar.

God bless America.

Hon?

Where are you?

Honey?

Honey, you in here?

Iderrito a mi familia!

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t!

f*cking animals.

Incredible.

They're even better matched than I thought-- True partnership.

You know, I rarely deviate from a plan, but I just didn't have the heart to split up such a...

...perfect couple.

You two... have quite a lucrative... operation going.

You're a really good team.

It's clever, too.

No one questions another drowned Cuban man or woman... or child.

So, which one of you thought this up?

They get freedom. We free them.

They thank us, for God's sake!

For drowning them and dumping their bodies in the ocean? Please.

We can pay you. We have money.

That's what it's all about, right?

I love you. I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I'm gonna ask you a question. I want you to answer me honestly.

No more bullshit. Do you understand?

How long have you been married?

12 years.

How do you love each other?

You're like me, and you make it work. How?

We want the same life.

We both-- We want the same thing.

You share the same dream.

Yes, exactly, yes.

Yes, that's it.

That's...

...helpful. Thank you.

No.

I like doing things properly, but I'm out of time, and I still have to dispose of them.

Valerie got short shrift.

But all in all, it was a very good night.

I like this place.

A lot of memories are buried down there.

Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

After all...

...isn't that what relationships are all about?

Do you have a dream...

...for your life...

Your future, I guess?

Of course. Do you?

It might sound weird.

I want to someday be content and just feel...

...comfortable, like everyone else.

I want...

A normal life.

Yeah, a normal life.

That's all I want. Just that.

No fame and fortune? Excitement at every turn?

No, I've had enough excitement. Thank you.

Now... I'll take boring.

Average.

Ordinary.

That's weird, huh?

Yeah.

Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

No blood -- What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the f*cking ice-truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment, he took some time to get to know me --

My life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No sh*t. He's in jail. But...

See, he still owes me for two ounces of blow, which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money, and I didn't have it.

Poor b*stards --

Spend their life savings, get stuffed into a fishhold.

They can't pay...

They disappear.

Jorge Castillo --

The only suspect even remotely close to the park where Yelina was supposed to drop the money.

Excuse me. Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño. Come on.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of sh*t.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

f*cking animals.

God bless America.

Taking the extra time to k*ll Valerie may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile.

Every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the 6-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

So how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish -- May he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over and taking care of this for me.

Dead stuff...

I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early is on its way.

I don't get birthdays -- The party, the song.

Celebrating another year just being alive feels... forced.

That one! That's the one I want.

Coconut it is.

I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.

I might have to settle for toast to go.

Morgan.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have k*lled them both. I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood --

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh? We're running her prints now.

It had to be him. He's watching me.

Dex?

Good. I.D. the victim.

You find anything else?

That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job. Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like a*s. The sooner you get busy, the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me for not k*lling that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck k*ller.

I've got the press sniffing outside already.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an I.D. -- Valerie Castillo.

And guess this. Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.

Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was k*lled here, which I doubt, whoever did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Prints?

She's clean.

This trailer -- That's another matter.

I don't even want to know what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.

Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today? You're throwing off my Chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah... I guess.

I'll let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh! Oh, god. Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

Well, the army taught me a lot of things.

I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump? That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars you got on your collar, Morgan.

Everybody's sh*t stinks.

Here we go.

We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's better half was knee-deep.

You like the husband for this?

It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number and a name -- Mariel.

Call it in to Batista. He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes!

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

Padre nuestro que está en los cielos.

Santificado sea tu nombre. Venga tu reino.

Hágase tu voluntad en la tierra...

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

No!

Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

Mi hijito, todo está bien. Te vamos a ayudar.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -- In the hands of a 7-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban and he seems to like Laguerta.

Spend enough time in a hot trunk, I guess she'd look good to anybody.

Did he... you know? see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.

Social services is on the way.

You okay? You got a whole brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies is crumbling all around me, and I can't tell a soul, especially not Deb.

Deb, we've been through this.

But I have my books. I mean, I could just stay in the car...

...or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet. You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

But Dexter was my age when --

Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting. Did you pack your swimsuit?

Yes.

Good girl.

I want to see that backflip when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car. We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, dad.

What we do on these weekends your sister can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people closest to you is how you'll survive...

...and how you'll protect them if anything ever goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up. You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store. Is there anything else you want for your party?

Balloons aren't much of a list.

It's okay. It don't need that other stuff. It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry about that stuff, okay?

It's your party. You can have whatever you want.

Hello?

Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with mom?

She only gets that way when she's talking to dad.

Hi.

I was able to track down that name Mariel with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.

She's staying with cousins. I had a cop bring her in.

Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless. They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and six others c*ptive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

And if the relatives don't pay the release fee, the coyote would dump their a*s overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick. Come on.

Mariel, estos son mis amigos que yo te dije.

Sargento Doakes y la detective Morgan. Puede sentar.

Mariel, when was the last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

¿Cuándo fue la ultima vez que tú viste a Jorge Castillo?

Cuando me encerró con los otros después de bajarnos del barco.

When he locked her and the other refugees up after pulling them from the boat.

No teníamos comida ni agua.

Un hombre trató de escapar. Jorge lo agarró y lo golpeó.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape, but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

¿Cómo escapó?

Alguien abrió la puerta al garaje. Y nos escapamos.

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

Cuando los agarren, espero que los hagan sufrir mucho, especialmente esa concha que nos trató como perro.

She said, "when we find them, to make them suffer for what they did, especially that concha that treated her like a dog.

Concha? Ah, got you.

f*ck me. The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up.

¿Y quién era el niño pequeño que estaba con usted?

¿Qué niño? Yo nunca vi un niño.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers, C.O.D. exsanguination -- So far, so good.

You're hovering.

Keep reading.

What am I looking for ?

Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time -- "M" f*cking 99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me, so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it. No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

I should have it for Doakes in the morning.

Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias I used will lead them back to me.

Ticktock.

Hey, you.

Thank god you're there.

I really need to talk with someone.

Everything okay?

Paul called after you left.

Paul? Who's Paul?

My soon-to-be ex. He's already out of jail --

Overcrowding. Can you believe it?

Every time something goes just a little bit right, something like this happens. He wants to come to Astor's party.

What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.

But even if I say "no", he won't listen. He never does.

Can you -- Can you come over tonight?

I don't know, I'm kind of under the g*n here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you. I'm sorry.

No, don't be. Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can. I promise.

Okay. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas. Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

Where's Laguerta?

Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

Sketch?

He told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

It sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God...

I feel like I need a shower just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching.

Phone records, bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and that's why he k*lled her.

Maybe.

This morning at the salvage yard, what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk, you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for Laguerta.

I would if she'd asked.

I didn't ask.

Fine.

Next time, just get your a*s shot.

It's possible our guy left town.

If he even did it.

What if we have a copycat k*ller?

That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?

Just hear me out.

What if the person who k*lled Valerie Castillo was trying to bleed her out like the ice-truck k*ller but didn't know how?

She wasn't a hooker.

But she was k*lled someplace else, dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner, just like all the others.

Except she wasn't in pieces.

But she had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage on the ice-truck k*ller, it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile, just in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time you've made that face. Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial K*llers get caught.

There's really not much of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.

I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling. My mom lives here.

Did you forget your laundry?

She's been on me to stop by for dinner. So I'm stoppin' by.

And here's the plan. We go in.

We eat. We out before the cheesecake. You got it?

I'm, what, your exit strategy?

Look, you can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or...

...you can come in and have some free food. It's your call.

sh*t!

My sisters are here, too.

f*cking family reunion!

So this john comes out of nowhere. He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my g*n and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan!

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family with this presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

Please, first words out of my baby brother's mouth were, "Got milk, m*therf*cker".

Oh, okay, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard on the news is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me like that, I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing okay.

The hospital's setting him up with some prosthetics.

I don't know, he's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts because of this ice-truck k*ller as*h*le, and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think with one body part, and that one was not cut off.

Ma!

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on. We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey? I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...

I would love some cheesecake bit.

You can wait in the car. That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll do the dishes.

I'll help you.

Ooh, I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time, if they'll even remember me, other than the man who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father.

They have a right to know he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. Even if I tell Paul not to come, he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper, but when he was using...

He said if I...

...left, he would find us and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying, I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it, but...

Astor...

She was the one who called the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.

You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up, we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, mom? Can he, mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead, her boyfriend's a serial k*ller.

It's kind of hard not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son. Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall, I'd almost feel guilty for hacking into Masuka's e-mail.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -- So wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon destroying evidence, but he never wanted me to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.

I was just checking some e-mail.

Can you take a look at this for me?

Copycat k*ller?

I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to Laguerta, but I want to make sure it's good enough.

I'm honored. "The similar manner in which the victim's body was displayed suggests this k*ller "feels a connection to the ice-truck k*ller, "excited by what he's doing. "The cut on the victim's cheek, while not fatal, "appears to be a signature of sorts. "Because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene, "the suspect may be familiar "with law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit? You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess --

Single white male, mid-30s, lives alone, disconnected from his emotions.

It's a little textbook, don't you think?

But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?

Keep this to yourself.

Really?

Deb, you're new to Homicide. This blows up in your face, you've given Laguerta the excuse she's been looking for to send you back to Vice.

No.

I'm on to something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra! What the hell do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry...

...on the top shelf.

You and your brother know never to touch my g*ns unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful! I mean, I was only sh**ting at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter, and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning, we have cadets from the academy going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo from that yard.

Because he didn't recognize a photo of Jorge Castillo, Lieutenant Laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Hola, Oscar.

¿Tú quieres venir conmigo?

Normally, I wouldn't approve of something like this, but you've made quite an impression.

You have kids?

No.

I was like him once --

A stranger in a strange place, left to grow up with strangers, all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant -- I'd say you've done okay.

Any luck with the family?

No. He talks about an Uncle Roberto.

He just uses the first name.

Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one of these kids into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors, animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If it turns up the husband is a dead end, then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan.

Any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now is to be profiled for all of Miami metro.

We could be looking at someone who's inspired by the ice-truck k*ller. A copycat.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures.

I have a profile. I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

Oscar...

¿El hombre que viste era como yo o más delgado?

Mi hijito, está bien. Cuéntanos.

Cuéntanos lo que tú viste esa noche.

I'll be right back.

No!

Está bien, me quedo aquí.

I forgot how much I loved pastelitos growing up.

He just needed a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

¿Quieres más?

¿Cinco?

Go get the artist. I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

No, dice que no.

Cinco no puede. Pero tres, sí.

No es 5, es 10.

¿10?

Te digo que tú hablas con el señor cuando el venga, y entonces, sí, yo te doy 10, lo que tú quieras. 20.

30.

50?

50.

Did you thank Mrs. Carrol for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything okay?

You want to talk out it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.

I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail.

Did not!

You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank god.

My arm's asleep.

How long have you two been like this?

Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age, when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth, and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head. I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work. I had some time to k*ll.

Go ahead. We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know what this little guy saw.

If you, um... here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something stuck on my lens.

Luckily, you're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs on my bras until I was 16. As you can see, not a whole lot's changed since then.

Morgan.

Try not to blink, okay?

Okay, okay. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry getting... personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem. My parents never talked about it much.

Oh, but still, raising a boy, it's a lot of work, no?

Dex? God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did. He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, you're impulsive, and you constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on --

Honey, what is it?

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it okay if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard --

Me.

Once the sketch is finished, there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival, I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons -- sn*per.

Yes, I did it. Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall -- Arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone burned alive?

Cindy Landon -- Black widow.

I'll f*ck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo -- My last victim.

He's not angry. That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity to paint me into a corner to see if I'd find my way out, if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample, transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy, almost as easy as it was lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile with the ice-truck k*ller list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch, take it from there.

I know, I know. I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch -- My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get a dirty word in edgewise with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was pancake night --

A Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood? You're sure?

This was found in the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items that come in.

Sometimes because of sheer volume, that takes time.

It doesn't prove anything.

Not by itself but I've been re-examining the video footage I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.

They're long, deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No sh*t.

The person who did this wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck k*ller. He was... in a hurry.

He was probably afraid of getting caught.

Most K*llers are.

Except if this was a copycat, he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first k*ll.

He would control the precise moment Valerie Castillo died instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too... passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

Well, he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7-year-old left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman. Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

Deb, I had to tell him.

No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept your f*cking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter. That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

Deb, you're my sister.

No, I am not. And he is my father!

There are so many times, I swear, Dexter, I wish he wouldn't have brought you home!

Dexter, I am... so sorry.

I really... really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

Look, we need to talk.

Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor, but, I mean, the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe -- Maybe it would be a good idea if you...

...don't come to the party.

I just want...

She is my daughter, too, Rita.

I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now, and you can't just drop in on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked and the restraining order is still in effect.

So if you step one foot on this property, the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second call is to your parole officer.

I need the sergeant.

Morgan.

I'll be right there.

Está listo.

Ya lo tiré.

Oscarsito.

Itío Roberto!

The uncle called our office this morning. He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?

He's a very special boy.

I know.

Cuídate?

L.T., you need to see this.

You okay?

These contacts.

Dios mío.

Wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside and lets a demo crew shred the truck before we find it.

No more m*rder w*apon.

There's blood.

Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband. You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan. Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me... eventually.

That's who she is -- Bighearted, kind.

Nothing like me.

Laguerta thought you should see this.

What you got ?

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a b*tch.

Dex.

Okay, I gave them Jorge's sock, a knife with his prints, and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too f*cking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid?

On his own for as long as Oscar was, who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them that Paul would not be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody, or it won't come true.

It already came true. Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

Okay.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer --

The hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me --

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.Previously on "Dexter"...

Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.

Hey, Angel, I got him!

They really found the ice-truck k*ller?

I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

The fun part was hanging them like cattle right before I cut their throats.

Son of a b*tch.

I have so many questions for him.

What was his message to me?

Now I need to know him.

Hi.

The f*ck are you?

Paul Bennett. Father on parole.

Dexter Morgan.

I can't think of anything clever to say.

Divorce papers -- Sign them now, and I'll agree to supervised visits twice a week.

You think you can really make me back down?

Are you f*cking my wife?

I just wish he'd go away.

I mean, why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

All along, I thought this was a game my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change, evolve, and this one's getting deep.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I'd better make the most of them.

Your instincts were dead-on.

They're always dead-on when it comes to K*llers. Why is that?

I'm watchin' you.

What are we looking at here?

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

You?

No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?

Why do bloodstains always look like crustaceans to you?

I like seafood.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

Not as hard as her.

Damn power outages.

I don't know, Angel.

Most firearm suicides are committed by men.

Women tend to slash their wrists, take pills, something more ladylike.

Not in Miami.

We closed a couple of su1c1de cases just like this last year, remember?

Look at this mess.

That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?

House husband. And aspiring artist.

Promising.

So, she supported him?

It looks like that.

She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

Those other suicides we closed -- those were high-powered women too, right?

I don't know. I think so.

Note to self.

I don't care what it looks like. Somebody k*lled her.

We're checking out all the possibilities, Mr. Gayle.

Was your wife dealing with any emotional problem?

You know, job stress, the usual, but she was working through it in therapy.

She have any other problems that you're aware of? Threats?

Are you listening to me? Vanessa didn't k*ll herself.

Criminals stage suicides all the time.

You don't even know the guys she put away.

We'll check into it.

We need to collect your clothes for evidence --

Standard procedure.

Come on. I got to go. There's a dead body in that house.

There's a hot body in here.

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you too.

Call me when you're done, okay?

Yeah. I'll bring handcuffs.

Morgan, what took you so long?

Playing "hide the salami" with Mr. Prosthetics?

I don't f*ck and tell.

Since when?

Can we go inside? I'm kind of wet.

Don't.

No, I need you to care of the neighbourhood.

See what you can find out about the victim's relationship with her husband.

It's always the husband, right?

Looks like a su1c1de, but you never know --

Younger guy, unemployed.

Maybe he was a boy toy and k*lled her for her money.

I'm on it.

Doakes is sending you away from a crime scene in a pouring rain and you're not putting up a fight?

I'm a team player.

You are?

f*ck you!

Hey, Dex, come on in.

Where's Rita?

She's stuck in traffic.

Power's out in half the city.

Of course, I love the extra kid time, but... court supervisor -- not so much.

Hey, you know, I feel really bad about the last time I was here.

I didn't mean to get all alpha male on you. It's just...

What are you supposed to say to the guy who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

Thanks for holding down the fort.

Do you mind if I get going?

I got kids of my own at home to look after.

No, no, no. It's okay.

Dexter and I are here now.

Great. Thank you.

Bye, kids.

Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.

They are? Hey, I brought hot chocolate.

Dad already made us some.

With extra marshmallows!

Tag -- You're it!

I'd love some hot chocolate.

Take two. Looks like he's got extra.

Come here, buddy.

Mom, can dad stay and put us to bed, please?

I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.

Dexter doesn't mind.

Only a song, no story --

It's way past your bedtime.

All right, bedbugs.

Let's leave these two alone.

It's not like they need a chaperone.

Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian, and now Vanessa Gayle --

All three powerful women, all three shot themselves in the past two years.

They've got to have more in common than career ambition and a fondness of firearms.

Why the sudden interest in suicides?

Morbid curiosity.

What can I do for you?

So many things...

I need the blood-spatter report on Vanessa Gayle.

Blood spatter's inconclusive. All I can tell is she was shot at close range. I wish I had more for you.

Me too.

Maria.

The D.A. needs the work sheet for the ice-truck-k*ller case.

I'm working on it.

When'd you talk to the D.A.?

We had dinner last night.

Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate Neil Perry's arrest --

Hell of a good time.

Hiro de puta.

I'm the one who gets Perry to confess and he's got the mayor kissing his a*s.

I wouldn't be too upset.

Matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough.

You still believe we got the wrong guy?

Perry's the pretender to the throne.

The real king is still out there, and he'll k*ll again.

It's just a matter of time.

Or the ice-truck k*ller will use Perry as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

You really think that might happen?

If Perry's the wrong guy and I let him take the fall?

Definitely.

Thanks, Dexter.

What if Laguerta's right?

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No.

He's got unfinished business with me.

Still, I can't just sit on my hands waiting for something to happen.

I need a distraction.

Nothing like some Little Debbies and a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

Talk to me, ladies.

What do you have in common?

Same sorority?

Pilates instructor?

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

The three su1c1de sisters shared the same therapist --

Dr. Emmett Meridian.

He must be terrible at his job.

So far, he comes up squeaky clean --

No malpractice suit, no disgruntled patients.

And I thought I was a master at damage control.

Perhaps I should schedule a session with the good doctor and try out a little reverse psychology.

Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

Hey, I expect the police to show up when I call, right?

The least I can do is clear my lunch hour for a cop in need.

So...

What brought you here?

A friend of mine died.

She k*lled herself.

I need to understand why.

How come?

She had everything going for her. It doesn't make sense.

To some people, death makes perfect sense.

Life -- That's the puzzle, like you, Sean.

What really brought you here?

I just told you I came --

To talk about your friend's su1c1de, I know.

I think you're using this su1c1de deal as an excuse to come see me.

You're absolutely right.

How could you tell?

I'm sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arm's length.

And what are my real intentions?

As soon as I pay for my lunch, you're gonna tell me that.

Excuse me a second.

Judging from what I've seen so far, I probably will.

This guy's good.

So why do his patients keep dying?

Vanessa's estimated time of death was Monday at 7:00 p.m.

Meridian was in session with Scott Solomon.

I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept his appointment that night.

So, we got... almond chicken, pork fried rice.

So, Sean, let's start with the basics. You married?

No.

Girlfriend?

Yes.

Sex life?

It's personal.

And this is therapy, where we share personal things.

You know, it might help me open up if you shared something about yourself. Why did you become a psychiatrist?

See what you just did?

Trying to take control like that?

You probably get away with it most of the time, too, right?

That's a way of preventing other people from getting close to you.

Let me ask you something, Sean.

Have you ever been close to anybody?

My foster father.

He's the only one who ever really knew me.

You're adopted?

Harry took me in when I was 3.

So tell me about Harry.

What kind of stuff did you guys do together?

You know, normal father-son stuff.

All right. Stop. Enough.

Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Nice ambush.

That was the perfect point of attack.

I can't believe I finally got you.

I won.

This isn't a game, Dexter.

No, I know.

It's not supposed to be fun.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's just --

You think I want to teach you these things?

This is the only way I know how to keep you out of an electric chair!

This is about survival, Dex.

Nothing else.

Got it?

You've got a visitor, Perry.

You miss me?

Don't flatter yourself.

I have to comb through your case before the trial, make sure I have my facts straight on the notorious ice-truck k*ller.

I confessed. What more do you need?

The evidence to line up.

We haven't been able to match your prints against the partial on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital.

Liquid nitrogen -- I use it to freeze the body parts.

It's extremely effective, but it burns like a b*tch.

Or you knew your prints wouldn't match, so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it.

Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

Just covering my bases, Neil.

We both want the same thing.

10 minutes alone with Angelina?

To see you convicted.

What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

How about immortality?

We found your mother's body under your house.

Now, you can go down as a pathetic loser who k*lled mom or... the most heinous k*ller in Florida's history --

Your choice.

If I'm going to become a legend, I need to be memorialized.

I want a reporter here to interview me -- Front page.

You're not allowed to talk to the press before the trial.

If you want me to cooperate, I'm sure you'll find a way.

Meridian had one thing right.

I do crave control.

The longer the ice-truck k*ller maintains radio silence, the less control I have.

Craigslist -- It's desperate, I know, but apropos.

Personal ads are filled with desperation. "Tyler from Key West," "speedos tanning on the beach," "touched your tits on Friday night" --

At least these folks aren't just standing by waiting for something to happen, and neither am I. "Dear Ken," "I'm in pieces." "Why the cold shoulder?" "Love, Barbie."

Hey, I got it.

Thanks.

Hey, I know you --

Monday night at Meridian's.

You're always leaving your 7:00

when I'm arriving for my 8:00.

You missed last week, right?

No, I was there.

I don't remember ever seeing you, though.

How do you like him?

Meridian?

Best thing that's ever happened to me...

So far.

How about you? You finding him helpful?

I'm a sociopath.

There's not much he can do for me.

Cute and funny.

Let me guess

-- Taken.

Girlfriend.

Lucky girl.

Well, thanks for the help, but I can handle it from here.

All right.

So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

My sexual hang-ups and control issues aside, I need a follow-up appointment -- to dig a little deeper.

Isn't that what therapy's all about?

Oh, my god.

I love your body.

I love your legs.

I love your arms.

I couldn't have made them better myself.

Are you crying?

I'm fine.

Then what?

I don't know.

I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

Everything about you is hot.

Tell me what you're feeling.

It's...

It's just...

Every time I've ever been naked with someone...

...we just f*ck.

But not this time?

This is different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds so f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love.

Ew...

Yes.

But, ew, promise me you'll never say that again.

What if I do?

Are you gonna cry about it?

You're so f*cked up.

What's up, rock star?

Look at you.

What you doing?

Where's the supervisor?

Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

Who wants to play monster tag?

I do!

You?

I'm coming after you.

You better run.

Paul, you know you're not allowed unsupervised visits.

I know. Big bad Paul needs a babysitter.

It's your day off, right?

Now, would it really be so terrible if we spent time with our kids together?

I have a lunch date with Dexter.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Mom, dad, come on!

I guess I could call Dexter.

It's official --

I'm nominating you for "mom of the year".

Here comes the monster.

Here comes the monster!

Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks, I don't always keep others at a distance.

Things are looking up already. "Hey Barbie. How would you like to suck my c*ck?"

Or not.

Clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime.

Hey, what's up? You were looking for me?

What did forensics come back with on Vanessa Gayle?

Gunpowder on her hand, none on her husband's, high-angle trajectory, no dr*gs in the tox screen.

It all points to su1c1de.

No chance it was m*rder?

Too bad, huh?

I had the husband pegged, too.

Was hoping he could help me score my own Sugar Mama.

Try Craigslist.

I already did --

Nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

Miami Metro can close this case as a su1c1de, but I'm still not convinced.

Maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts.

You seem on edge today.

I'm not getting what I came here for.

What'd you come here for?

We established in our last visit that it wasn't to talk about su1c1de.

Or feelings.

Heaven forbid.

So, what do you want to talk about?

Fakes --

People who pass themselves off as something they're not.

Like a pre-owned-car salesman?

A brave politician.

A Jew for Jesus.

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Is that how you feel, Sean?

Like you're hiding a dark secret?

No, I wasn't talking about me.

Who you're talking about?

You.

That's a common first-time reaction to therapy.

You think I can't care about you, that I'm only pretending to care because I have another motive.

Bingo.

You got me.

I do have another motive.

It's called a paycheck.

But that doesn't mean that I can't care for my patients or enjoy my job.

How are things at your job?

Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

What kind of forensics do you do?

Blood spatter.

Most people can't stand blood.

I hate it.

Categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you.

Yeah, it is, actually.

So, okay, how are things with your girlfriend?

She canceled lunch with me to be with her ex-husband.

Sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now.

No wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions.

That way you never have to feel powerless.

So, then, what should I do?

Accept that certain things are out of your hands.

Let go.

Hey, Morgan --

I can't believe, out of two million sperm, you were the fastest swimmer.

What are you gonna do about it?

I wanted to k*ll him, dad.

It must have been tough for you to walk away, son.

I'm proud that you did that.

Don't be, because I still want to k*ll him.

When's that gonna go away?

I think I have everything I need, Mr. Perry.

When's the story gonna run?

Well, they're saving space for tomorrow, front page.

I just got to get back and write.

Thanks so much for your time.

How was your interview?

It was fine.

You ready to talk about the case?

Sure.

As soon as I get to talk to a reporter.

You just did.

Oh, give me a break.

That poser was one of your cop buddies, But nice try.

In case you forgot, Neil, you're the one in jail. I call the sh*ts.

Wrong. I could invoke my Miranda rights at any time and lawyer up.

It's that too wrong beacause if you wanted a lawyer, you'd have one by now.

I know your game, lieutenant.

You think I'm a fraud and you're trying to prove it, but the truth is you're the fraud.

You know what, Neil?

I'm really not in the mood for your sh*t today.

I found out how you got promoted.

Back when you and sergeant Doakes were still partners, Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer, brought you along for the ride.

How did you get...?

When the perp bailed from a Third-Story apartment, Doakes took the fire escape, sent you to cover the stairs.

Just in case.

Only...

You got lucky, and you made the headline grab, and so the legend began.

I wonder if Doakes would have made a good lieutenant.

I deserved that promotion.

I'm sure you did.

It was a big bust.

Not as big as catching me, of course, but, uh, let's be honest.

You didn't catch me.

Your captain did.

At least that's what they're saying on the news.

My therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands.

Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands, Not if I can find proof that the death of at least three women under his care was not a coincidence.

Breaking and entering.

I hope he got my good side.

Now, what's he recording for posterity's sake?

Goodbye, Dexter.

Hello, ladies.

I need another prescription.

I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

Just one more, please.

We talked about this.

The antidepressants were a temporary crutch so that you could start taking steps on your own.

But you don't understand. I can't do this on my own.

I can't even get out of f*cking bed.

I just -- I want to die.

Look at me.

I understand the appeal of death, okay?

No more pain.

All the career pressure, the hopelessness, gone.

In many cultures, there's no stigma attached to taking one's life.

su1c1de's respected, even revered as a matter of personal conscience.

How do most people do it?

Well, painkillers are the most common.

But they're entirely unreliable.

The truly courageous of heart... use g*ns.

You took women who trusted you at their weakest possible moment, and rather than help them, you suggested they end it all.

God, you even gave them permission to use a g*n.

You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

Create their drug addiction, pull them off, then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of su1c1de.

I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

...okay?

It is now.

Okay, just, I wanted to see you.

I felt bad about missing lunch to be with Paul and the kids.

I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

No, of course not.

How'd it go?

Really good and incredibly scary.

For the first time in a long while, I... saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life.

Why is that scary?

Because...

I like my new life.

And I finally feel like I'm in control.

I never felt that way with Paul.

I do with you.

This is a disaster.

I chose Rita because she was damaged.

If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

I'm ready, Dexter.

I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

You're the perfect boyfriend.

I want you to spend the night, for real.

I'm so sorry.

I came over here because I thought something was wrong.

But tonight's really not a good night.

I'm right in the middle of a case. I'm way too distracted.

Now? It's so late.

That's all the more reason to get back to work.

The clock's ticking. Here.

But I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

Okay.

sh*t.

I can't have sex with Rita.

Every time I sleep with a woman, she sees me for what I really am --

Empty --

And then she's gone.

But I don't want Rita to go, which means I have to deal with this.

I can't k*ll Meridian yet. I need another therapy session.

Stay where you are. I'm armed.

With bad puns?

You said you needed a favor. What's up?

Take off your pants.

Oh, I should have known it was that kind of favor.

You never ask me to come by before work.

No, but I like the way you think.

I have a patient who lost both her legs in a car accident, really brutal.

Like your mom?

Which is why I want to do something special for her.

I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs --

Yours.

No.

Let me just take a cast.

No way, no.

It'll take 20 minutes, tops.

I don't --

Come on, please?

Stop being such a chick. Sit down.

Feels good.

Can I make one of your c*ck?

That'd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen, huh?

Not likely.

I haven't told anyone about us.

Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

Not even a little.

Then why?

I guess this matters to me.

So if I talk about it and it goes away, I'm actually losing something.

That Ret*rded?

No.

But I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

Seriously?

And neither are you, 'cause I got your leg.

Where the hell you been?

With my boyfriend.

Boyfriend?

Yep.

We just f*cked in his office.

And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

You looking for me?

Yeah.

Shut the door.

Did you tell anyone about our bust, the one that got me promoted?

No.

Nobody in the press?

Maria, we talked about this when it happened.

It would f*ck up your rep and make me look like a whiny b*tch.

It's bad for both of us.

So then the only way to access that information would be to read to police report, right?

I guess.

We have to have our firewall checked.

She was sitting on top of me, basically naked...

...asking me to spend the night, and I didn't know what to do.

It's okay, Sean.

Don't beat yourself up.

Your girlfriend really means something to you. I know that.

If she means something, why do I run away from her?

To the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out.

Cause you're afraid they won't like what they see.

Yeah, I think you're right.

How can I change that?

Well, for starters, you accept the fact that we all have a big, bad wolf hiding inside of us, a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

Do you?

Of course I do.

Really?

And how do you deal with your wolf?

Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

I made friends with it.

And now I just let it out for a big meal once in a while.

At least three times that we know about.

Can we get back to the sex thing?

This is all about sex.

The reason you avoid sexual intimacy is because you don't want to surrender control.

No, I've surrendered control. It's not like my... girlfriend hasn't been, you know, south of the border.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Intimacy --

Really letting go face-to-face --

There's nothing more difficult than that.

The minute you start to accept who you are, you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together.

What are you doing?

I'd like to talk you through a deep-relaxation technique.

It might bring some things to the surface.

What kinds of things?

There must have been a time in your life when you felt powerless, right?

Foster child, no control over your destiny.

If we can bring some of those memories to the surface, we might find the root of your control issues.

First, I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

I want you to count each breath, okay?

In, 1, and out, 2. Just give it a try.

This is ridiculous. I could be k*lling him right now.

Now I want you to think of a time when you felt completely and totally powerless.

Hey, Morgan. You still f*cking your sister?

Leave me alone, Josh.

I told you to walk away!

God damn it, Dexter.

There are consequences to everything you do in life.

Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

I found the grave, son.

I'll be like this forever?

Mommy!

I have to get out of here.

Sean, come here.

Sean, Sean. Sean!

Oh, my god.

Are you okay?

Stay.

Stay with me.

You're sweet.

I am?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

And a time after that.

Don't you?

No. I mean, yeah.

I just...

I didn't freak you out?

Why would you think that?

Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that would scare me away.

I really hope you came to apologize.

Nope. I came for a consult.

And you brought beverages?

I got this on loan from the morgue.

Now, I could use an expert opinion, specifically your expert opinion.

See, we can't figure out exactly how the k*ller cut off this head.

Can you?

Nope.

Really?

I think you can.

I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

Maybe you need a closer look.

No! Keep it away.

I talked to the medical examiner.

He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

Said it might have been a heart attack.

I k*lled her.

You don't have the b*lls.

I mean, you had to wait till she died to chop her up.

And even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head.

Not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill, is it?

Oh, f*ck you!

Serial K*llers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

Especially the ice-truck k*ller. You know, you're not the first groupie to take credit for someone else's work.

Oh, bullshit!

I know details about the case, things that weren't published in the newspapers.

That's because you hacked into our computer system.

That's why I had the I.T. guys check our firewall.

The DMZ was breached. You read all our police reports.

You even got yourself a nice paneled car last month.

Nice touch, by the way.

Why are you doing this?

Because you're not a k*ller.

You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

Maybe you need another look.

No, take it away.

All right, I lied, okay?

Just, I need you to take it away from me...

Please.

So, what's on your mind, lieutenant?

We got a lot to get done before Perry's trial.

Yeah, about that trial --

I've got some bad news.

Perry recanted his confession this morning.

What are you talking about?

I was going over some details with him at county, and he admitted that he gave us a false confession.

He's a wannabe, Tom.

Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

How do you know which time he was lying?

All due respect, Maria, if we dropped charges every time someone recanted his confession, our jails would be empty.

We're going to trial.

All due respect, Captain, that's really not up to you.

It's up to the D.A.

I understand your frustration, Maria, but I reviewed the D.A. work sheets.

The evidence is compelling.

We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

Fair enough.

If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

I was really worried about you. You sure you're all right?

I kept calling your house, but I think the number you gave me didn't work.

You wouldn't have reached me anyway, 'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

I spent the night.

Face-to-face.

Sean!

That's very good.

It's all good, doctor.

I even stopped worrying about that friend of mine who's been out of touch.

You can't control other people, you know?

This is a real breakthrough. You should be proud of yourself.

I am proud.

Truth be told, I never expected to... make progress in therapy.

That's not true.

If that were true, you never would have come in here in the first place.

What do you want to focus on today?

Glad you asked that.

I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Okay.

I'm a serial k*ller.

Oh, god!

Oh, that feels so -- so amazing to say out loud!

Well, you must be letting go, because I've never heard you make a joke before.

I'm not joking. I k*ll people.

There it is again.

You should try it.

I know.

Your big, bad wolf has racked up a tidy little death toll.

I'm just kidding.

I disabled the cameras, and I copied the files.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Then focus on your breathing, maybe you'll remember --

Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

Those sessions are confidential!

I'm a control freak, I know.

But I watched your home movies. It's amazing stuff --

dr*gs, g*ns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

No wonder you're so well versed in control issues.

You got quite the God complex.

This session's over.

Not so fast, doc.

You're awake.

Shall we analyze your dreams?

No. That's right.

You've already told me everything I need to know, except... why powerful women?

You took powerful women and made them powerless.

They left behind families, children.

I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

You've helped me make a major self-discovery.

The fact that I'm a k*ller...

...that's something I can't control.

You helped me to accept what I really am.

I'm grateful for that.

But...

I was raised with a certain set of principles.

I'm sorry, doc.

Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

I'm gonna have to let you go.

♪ My darling ♪

♪ Turn the radio up for that sweet sound ♪

♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪

♪ Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control ♪

Hello?

Is that Eric Carmen?

No. What's up?

I'm running late. I'm in the middle of some housework.

If I don't get it done before we see, it's gonna drive me crazy.

I never knew you were so a**l.

And I'm a neat freak.

You're just full of surprises, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.

I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

Okay.

Barbie, be patient.

One day we'll share a cold one.Previously on "Dexter"...

What if the ice-truck k*ller does disappear?

No, he's got unfinished business with me. "Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

Why the cold shoulder? Love, Barbie."

Paul called after you left.

He's already out of jail -- Overcrowding.

Can you believe it?

Are you f*cking my wife?

Next time, we'll figure out what to tell the kids so you don't have to sneak out like this.

You want there to be a next time?

I just wish he'd go away.

Why can't he just go away and disappear forever?

I so want to maul you right now.

I so want you to.

It's different.

It feels like...

I hate saying this. It sounds f*cking cheesy.

It feels like making love. "Barbie, be patient. "One day we'll share a cold one."

Thank god for showers. Private time to think --

Harder to come by now that I'm in a real relationship.

Do you mind?

Not at all.

Could you pass the soap?

Yeah.

It's locked!

Mom, I got to pee!

I'll be right there, sweetie!

Hold on a second, buddy!

I can't!

Sorry. One-bathroom house.

Nature calls.

Cool. How did you get that ugly scar?

Cody!

Sword fight -- I won.

Mom, I got to brush.

Whatever happened to knocking?

I'm gonna be late for school.

You brush, you pee, I'm just gonna...

I mean, what does "separation" mean to you?

What "separation" means to me is that you're separated, and you work it out. Now, this was false pretenses.

I mean, I knew she wanted a divorce when she asked for the separation -- she lied.

Yeah, and you didn't when you were cheating on her, right? "Cheat" -- One cheat.

Got it.

That's in the singular.

One.

Okay.

And I felt so crappy, I told her the next day.

That's your problem. You're too damn honest.

She wouldn't even talk about it.

And I tried to get her to see a counselor with me.

Forget that.

Stop the car, man!

What?

Stop the g*dd*mn car!

Stop! Police!

Doakes! Doakes!

You all right?

Yeah.

The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard, according to his driver's license.

Haitian?

That'd be my guess.

All right. Let's go over it again.

I saw a g*n in the suspect's waistband.

I went to question him, and he took off running when he saw me.

Angel, you saw all this?

Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt, and I turned the car around in pursuit.

All right, and when you went under the causeway...

He took a shot at me.

I took cover and returned fire from that corner.

No, not from there.

Yeah, from f*cking right there.

But...

If you shot him from right there, the blood spatter would go in that direction. Look at the patterns.

You questioning me? 'Cause I got questions for you.

The man's just doing what he's supposed to do.

The man is a f*cking creep job!

James. Just focus on the facts, okay?

The D.A.'s team is ready for you. You good?

I'm good.

Yeah. You're up next.

Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.

He just got mixed up is all.

Hell, I'm not even sure what the hell happened.

Trauma can distort the memory.

Come on. I want you and Rita to meet my boyfriend.

It's just hard to get a babysitter on a Friday night.

Dex, you're my brother. You should know my boyfriend.

You really like using the "B" word, don't you?

Well, Rudy is my g*dd*mn boyfriend, so stop making bullshit excuses.

Honestly, our last double date was a little awkward.

I just want to make sure this one's gonna... stick.

Well, thanks for the vote of f*cking confidence!

Dex, Rudy's different.

I feel safe with him. I think...

I'm falling for him.

Excuse me. Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

Right here.

Oh, that was easy.

An urgent registered letter?

Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

Dex, you got a second?

Yeah.

Hey, you finish your report on the sh**ting?

I'm walking it up to I.A. right now.

You still think Doakes'

version doesn't add up?

Blood never lies.

sh*t.

Listen, um...

Can you sit on that till I talk to Doakes?

Here.

Now it's yours to sit on, stand on, do what you want.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know, it's a federal offense to read someone else's mail. "We regret to inform you of the death of your father"?

Dad died 10 years ago.

This isn't about Harry. "Joseph Driscoll of Dade City, Florida, names his son, "Dexter Morgan of Miami, "as his executor."

It's a will.

Well, he can't be your biological father.

Dad said he died before you came to live with us.

He wouldn't make a mistake like that. "The body's awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin."

I'm your only next of kin.

Don't you f*cking forget it.

Oh, and I inherited a house.

I know the truth, because Harry always told me the truth.

He had to.

He was teaching me principles, a code.

He knew what I would become without it.

So Joseph Driscoll of Dade City must have been mistaken.

You know what this is?

This is Dexter's new birth certificate.

The adoption finally went through.

You're a Morgan now.

I thought I was already a Morgan.

Well, you have been to us, but it's official now.

It took a long time and a lot of hurdles.

This is an important day for us.

Hey, dad?

How come you never told us what happened to Dexter's real parents?

Well, they died.

I know, but how?

I don't know.

Let's not talk about it.

No, how did they die, dad?

It was an accident, a tragic accident.

So, have you found out anything else about this Joe Driscoll?

Well, I looked online. I even -- looked at police records. There are no birth records, no driver's license, just the deed to the house...

And a mention in the local paper about his bowling team.

That's odd.

Yeah, I spoke to the probate lawyer, the guy who drafted the will.

And apparently Joseph Driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind, with no doubts about who I was.

Dexter, you're not feeling any of this, are you?

You're obviously so overwhelmed that you've shut down.

Maybe.

It's too much for you to handle.

Yeah. I guess.

So I think I should come with you.

Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

Trust me. You'll need me.

I fell asleep.

Sex like that takes a lot out of a person.

So, are we still seeing your brother for dinner Friday night?

No.

He's got to go to Dade City.

What's in Dade City?

I told you he was adopted, right?

Yeah.

Some dead guy up in Dade f*cking City thought he was Dexter's biological father and left him a house.

Really?

Man.

It's a mistake, a big one.

Still, though, that's got to... open up some old wounds.

When are you leaving?

Me?

I'm gonna stay in bed with you all weekend.

I thought you two were close.

We are.

Dex just likes to deal with things on his own.

He doesn't need my help.

Or...

He doesn't know how to ask for it.

I left a message so we wouldn't have to have this conversation.

Yeah, which is why I hustled over here, so we could hash this out like adults.

Admirable, Paul, but this adult is still going out of town.

Not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids.

That's not your call.

The kids are already settled at Colleen's.

You can have your visit when we get back.

It's just that I already laid out cash for the tickets.

A death in the family trumps the circus.

Dexter is not your family. I am.

You ready?

Hey, Paul.

Better hit the road.

They should have served a cardiologist with these burgers.

We had to eat them.

Junk food's the unwritten rule of the road.

It's nice.

The lawyer said there should be a key under the mat.

Are you my new neighbors?!

No.

No, we're just here to clear up some things with the estate.

So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

He was only 60, you know -- Too young for a heart attack.

He used to clean my gutters every fall.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now...

Unless you know how to clean gutters.

We're not gonna be here for that long.

But, uh, you have a good day.

A bachelor lived here, that's for sure.

Well, we can head back tomorrow morning, as soon as I straighten things out at the morgue.

I don't want a house in Dade City.

Which means it's gonna need to be packed up.

And I don't think anybody else is gonna do it, so I guess that leaves us.

Told you you'd need me.

Hey, James.

Hey, man.

I.A. is pressing me on my report of the sh**ting.

Yeah.

There's just one thing that I can't get clear on.

It's pretty clear from where I was standing.

Yeah...

Except...

I could have sworn that I heard your 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

Now, there's lots of reasons it could have gone down that way.

If Bayard even just aimed at you, it's still all right to sh**t.

Except he shot first, when I came around the corner.

Yeah. Maybe you're confused about that too because the blood-spatter report says it couldn't have gone down that way.

You saying I'm a liar?

No. I'm saying that maybe you're not remembering right.

This may come as a f*cking shock to you, Angel, but you're not the only honest cop in Miami.

Look, I just want to know why a man is dead.

You want to come at me, you come at me straight.

You want it straight? I did not see a g*n!

Angel.

I need to talk to you.

Help me out, man.

Is that Joe?

Must be.

It's weird, but he looks a little bit like you...

But not really.

Those seem to be the only pictures in the house.

There's no family or kids' photos.

Lonely.

Dexter. Hi.

Hey.

Surprise.

I know you can't ask for my help, but it's my duty to, you know...

Help while you deal with old wounds...

Or wha-- Jesus. Whatever. I'm here.

So it appears.

And this is Rudy.

I've waited a long time to meet you.

And you must be Rita.

Hi.

He came here for me -- For the both of us.

Isn't he great?

A lot of work to pack all this up.

Even with the four of us, it'll take us the whole weekend.

The whole weekend? Where should I put our stuff?

It's too eerie, sleeping in a dead man's house.

I saw a Motel 6 on the way in.

We could stay here and save the money.

I mean, it is late, and we'd probably get more packing done if we stayed here.

It's up to you, Dex.

Just say the word.

As long as you don't mind the sofa bed.

Okay, I'll go look for some clean sheets.

How did a death turn into a couples' weekend?

Luckily, I get up earlier than normal people.

Coffee?

Thanks.

I've got to hit the morgue.

Want company?

No.

Thank you, though.

It's private.

I get it.

I gave Joe a physical once a year, like clockwork, so no history of heart disease, but it happens.

It appears so.

We were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you.

We thought his son should have a chance to pay his last respects.

I'm not his son.

Estrangement in a family is a shame, but death is the great unifier.

That's an interesting tattoo.

Joe said he picked that up in Nam.

You can be proud. He was a patriot.

Uh, perhaps he was also an ex-convict.

Excuse me?

It's a prison tattoo.

It's done with a pen and ballpoint ink.

It's three or four decades old, judging by the fade.

Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.

He was a good man, a quiet man, and a damn good bowler.

How'd you determine cardiac arrest?

Was there damage to the coronary artery?

It's, uh, professional curiosity.

I work in forensics, down in Miami.

I see.

Well, uh, I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

It's common with seizures during a heart attack.

It's also a sign of diabetic retinopathy.

Son, I may be a small-town doctor, but I know a heart attack when I see one.

Who knows what caused it --

Stress, inactivity...

French fries --

But knowing won't bring him back.

It's hard to accept so many unanswered questions, but sometimes...

No, you're right... Dr. Pittman.

Yeah, this is really hard.

You mind if I just take a minute alone with...

Dad?

I'll be next door in my office.

Masuka.

Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

Dude, I know your last name.

I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

I thought you were away with the girlfriend.

What? She surfing the Crimson wave?

I'm just helping out a local agency.

I'm gonna send you two blood samples.

I need it A.S.A.P.

Do a tox screen, will you?

Hey, Romeo, if this is your idea of a romantic weekend, you're gonna be a bachelor for a very long time.

Yeah.

Run another I.V. Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

What's his pressure?

It's 80 and dropping.

We may need to do a belly tap.

Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

It hurts, dad.

What happened?

He tried to climb a fence to get Debra's ball, but a dog chased after him, and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

Is he gonna be all right?

We can keep him stable for a while.

But he's gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding, and that's a problem.

Can we talk over here, please?

Dex, I'll be right back.

Hold your brother's hand, sweetie.

Okay, the complication is with your son's blood type.

I don't want to talk about this.

Why are you being like this?!

You don't need to mention that in front of anybody.

Are you crazy?! He could die.

You got to do something quick. You've got to go now.

So, you heard the .38 go off before sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.

Then I went under the causeway, and I saw the suspect...

Mr. Bayard...

Mr. Bayard on the ground, his g*n lying next to him.

And you're sure it was Mr. Bayard's g*n?

Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

And Sergeant Doakes had his niner in his hands.

Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the g*n before the foot chase began?

Sergeant Doakes did.

Did you see Mr. Bayard acting suspiciously?

Did you know Mr. Bayard worked as a janitor?

I --

How the f*ck would I know that?

Never got so much as a parking ticket since he immigrated from Haiti 15 years ago.

He got a lot more than that this time, didn't he?

Are you sure you heard the .38 go off before Sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter?

Joe bought this house outright in 1976, paid cash, no records before that.

No records, no childhood photos...

The guy was 60, but it's like his life started when he was 30.

You know, you're right.

He's right.

So, what happened between years one and 29?

Maybe he butchered his entire family.

Yeah...

Or he walked out on his two wives and a lot of bad debt.

The guy was a loser, after all.

Who else owns this many bowling b*lls?

What do you think, Dex?

I think Joe spent some time in prison, probably mixed with some bad people.

Maybe he had to hide from them.

Whatever it was, dr*gs were involved --

Narcotics anonymous.

Paul used to get these, except he never made it past the welcome chip.

Looks like Joe was clean for...

Let me guess --

30 years.

Well, Joe said no to the dr*gs, but not his rock 'n' roll.

Nothing in his collection post-1980.

Got to love a purist.

Oh, good. Dancing.

Hello?

Hey, babe. It's Paul.

Just making sure dear Dexter is dealing decently with his dead dad.

We're fine.

Everyone's fine, OK?

We'll see you on Monday.

No, no, no.

Talk to me.

You having fun? 'Cause I'm not.

Paul.

I would have.

I could have taken my kids to the circus.

We'd be eating peanuts right now, stepping in elephant sh*t.

Paul, this is not helping my confidence in you.

Oh, I think you've got enough confidence for both of us.

Look, if you want to work towards building more visitation days, not less, you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here.

Now, I think you might just want to politely hang up.

Okay.

You're right.

I'm sorry.

You have a great weekend.

A secret life --

The only thing Joe and I have in common.

There's nothing else in this house to connect us.

Hiding out?

Cleaning up.

I can only imagine what you're going through.

A lot of lemon-fresh joy.

You joke.

It's good defense, by the way.

Thank you. I think.

Still, the possibility has got to be weighing on you.

What possibility?

That Joe could actually be your dad.

The only way that's a possibility is if Harry was wrong. And, uh, that's just not possible.

Or he lied.

Don't you worry, little man. You're not gonna feel a thing.

I thought there was a problem -- you know, the blood?

Your dad fixed it.

See, you have a very special blood type -- A.B. negative.

It's hard to come by, and our supply was low.

But your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours.

You're very lucky.

Can I have a moment with my son?

Yeah.

Hey, Dex.

Everything's gonna be fine.

You'll be good as new.

I will?

Hey, would I lie to you?

When my father was dying, he just asked me for one thing --

Debería ser un hombre honesto. "Be an honest man."

That's all he asked.

I made him that promise, and that's why I'm a cop.

Now this Haitian man is dead, and I don't know why, but I know it ain't right.

But if I talk...

I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

But if I lie --

Hold up.

Go ahead.

The blood spatter doesn't match Doakes' report.

Also...

...I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter go off before the .38.

But he must have had good cause.

So Doakes fired first?

Doakes fired first.

I hope tuna's all right.

Mmm, love me a little mercury.

That's Dexter's.

Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can space from the neighbors.

Criminal -- I like it.

It's the station.

Morgan here.

Wait.

Did I call the hot Morgan by mistake?

Freudian.

My subconscious has been exposed.

Well, zip it up and tell me what's going on.

I got the results.

On Doakes' sh**ting? Has he been cleared?

On the DNA test.

What DNA test?

You trusted dad your entire life, so why question him now?

Am I missing something?

DNA test?

Masuka called?

Your biological father was dead.

Dad told us that.

I remember.

So, the DNA came back negative?

It was a match.

Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

Interesting.

Do you think dad... lied?

I think he might have known Joe was here...

...Five hours up I-95 my whole life.

Well, he must have had a damn good reason.

And I'm not gonna let some guy you didn't even know draw him into question.

Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

That's why you got a tox screen, too.

I need to clear my head.

Where are your car keys?

Deb, I ordered the tox screen because Joe had no history of heart disease and the coroner's report was inept.

You did it because, for some reason, he is important to you.

It was professional curiosity.

Then you will be professionally glad to know that the only toxin in his system was a sedative, which he probably took to...

I don't know, sleep.

That would surprise me.

Joe was 30 years sober, I haven't found anything stronger than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

It wouldn't be the first time an addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle when he was injected with something.

Like?

Diabetic insulin.

It can cause cardiac arrest.

We've seen it before.

It's nearly impossible to detect unless you can find a point of injection, which I wasn't looking for, but if I had a chance to examinate the body, I --

Jesus Christ!

He's not even your family!

Mom and dad were.

I am.

Are you gonna start questioning me now?

You? Why would I --

Joe Driscoll was obviously bad f*cking news, which is why dad didn't want you to know anything about him!

Doesn't that matter to you?!

I don't know what you want from me.

I want what dad wanted.

I want nothing to do with this guy.

Let's just finish packing up this crappy house and walk the f*ck away!

All right. That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

I guess I understand why Deb is upset.

We both idolized Harry, lived by what he taught us...

Though Deb never had to be taught not to k*ll innocent people.

That's why she doesn't understand why I need to know.

Howdy, neighbor.

Let me get that for you.

Well, thank you.

I was just wondering --

Did you happen to notice any visitors over at Joe's last week?

Visitors?

Oh, I'm not sure.

I'm just wondering if he has any outstanding bills --

A gardener, maybe, or a delivery person, repairman?

Well, come to think of it, there was a, um, cable repairman here last week.

He was polite.

But, you know, he couldn't fix my  TV antenna.

You remember what he looked like?

Well, he had dark hair...

Average height -- Normal, I suppose.

I did some checking on our suspect Jacques Bayard.

You lending I.A. a hand?

I just like to know what's going on in my department.

And what is going on?

Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his name when he immigrated here.

Used to be Rene Thibault, a former officer in the Haitian military.

Didn't your tour in the army include some... special op in Haiti?

Right. "Special" means you don't talk about it.

But I know you've heard as many horror stories as I have about what went on down there with those death squads.

What were they called?

Tonton Macoute.

Yeah, "the bogeymen."

They did a lot of terrible things, k*lled a lot of people.

They made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons, forced fathers to r*pe their daughters.

They tied cinder blocks around people's necks and drowned them and put mutilated bodies in trees and k*lled anybody who tried to take them down.

This man, Jacques Bayard, if he did those things... he deserved a lot worse than he got.

Don't worry, James.

It'll be over soon.

I know it will.

If Joe was shot up with insulin, there will be an injection welt...

Maybe between his toes or in a freckle.

If it's there, I'll find it.

Small towns.

Come on, Dr. Pittman, which crematorium did you send Joe to?

Hey! You! stop! Come on!

Get in!

Heard you sneak out.

Took a guess where you were headed.

Figuring I'd need a ride?

Figured I could talk you out of it.

No such luck, huh?

Deb will be delighted.

As far as I know, you went out for a walk.

Jesus, Dex, did you steal something?

Well, my fingerprints were all over it.

I figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence.

It's just a box of ashes.

Joe was cremated, then?

Yep.

Guess you weren't able to find out if he was injected with anything.

No.

What are you gonna do with him?

I don't know.

Hmm, dumpster?

I have a better idea.

You know...

No matter what Harry said, no matter what Deb thinks, that's your father.

Cardboard box?

I know you don't want to acknowledge it, which is why you're running around, breaking and entering, searching for some k*ller.

But you took that because there's a part of you that knows that this... that box... is your real father.

My father.

Sounds strange.

I know.

You all right?

I was just getting some air.

Oh, hey, I found something in Joe's closet.

It's just a bunch of papers.

They're over there.

Any clues?

Hey, buddy.

How you feeling?

Good.

It kind of itches, but they have ice cream here.

Life's a trade-off.

What are you making there?

A thank-you card.

See? The nurse brought me the crayons and everything.

Who's it for?

Well, she said I should thank the man who gave me the blood.

I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank-you cards?

Yes, it is.

It's just that he's gone.

And we won't be seeing him again.

I'm sorry.

That's all right.

It doesn't really mean anything.

Yeah, it does.

You keep drawing, son.

I'll make sure it finds him.

Okay.

You had the case dropped?

Excuse me.

I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

Do you seriously think I have any say over what I.A. does?

I put everything on the line.

I told I.A. the truth, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up.

What the hell happened?

Maria! I deserve to know.

All I know is that I.A. got a call from an agency in Washington.

What agency?

I'm guessing military.

They said the case involved some -- sensitive foreign-relations issues, so they were gonna handle it from there.

They disappeared it.

I always knew Doakes had a history with them.

I figured Special Forces, but this kind of reach --

You think it was black ops, CIA?

Maybe.

Probably.

And I ratted him out. Jesus Christ.

Angel...

You did what you thought was right.

Squeak, squeak.

Do you have a problem?

Officer Benson, you just bumped into your superior.

I believe you owe detective Batista an apology!

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know I should be sorry that we met under these circumstances, but truthfully, I think it was the best way to get to know you.

Realtor says you won't get much for it.

More than if I kept it.

Are we good?

We're fine.

All right.

I'll see you back at the station.

Cable repair man.

Wait! Wait! No, no, don't go.

Wait!

Please, I want to ask you something.

Wait!

Alone again.

Finally.

You know what?

I'm glad you were here.

Thought you would be.

The cable repairman --

Did he say anything about my  TV antenna?!

No!

Rita, it's me.

They're asleep.

Yeah, well, I should have been here, okay?

It's late, and you're drunk and you can't keep coming by here unannounced.

You don't call the sh*ts, okay?

Paul, I want you to leave.

I don't give a f*ck what you want.

I want my f*cking kids!

You're gonna scare them.

They don't want to see me?

Those kids are gonna remember who the head of this f*cking family is.

You're right.

I've been awful.

I just didn't realize I was hurting you so much.

But I can make it up to you.

Let me try.

Where are you going?

Want to play rough? Huh? Is that what you want?

No! No!

f*cking whore.

Come on. Come on!

Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

I had a father...

Someone other than Harry who called me son.

The thought never even occurred to me.

Harry was all I needed.

It was Harry who always had the answers.

He knew who was good, bad, safe...

And dangerous.

I built my life on Harry's code.

I lived by it.

But Harry lied.

Why would he do that?

What else don't I know?

My concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand.

Maybe Rudy was right --

You never can truly know anyone.
